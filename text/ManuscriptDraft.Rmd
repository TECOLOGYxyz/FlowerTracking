abstract: ABSTRACT | Often simple variables will be used to describe the flowering phenology of a population of plants, e.g. onset or peak of flowering and to infer respones to climate change. Here we show that image-based monitoring of field plots at very high temporal resolution can return information on flowering phenology at the level of indiviuals. Further, we present an automatic flower tracking algorithm.

# Introduction

The flowering phenology of a population may mask responses at the individual level. For example, 

Does flower visitation rates and/or reproductive success depend on the timing of flowering for the indiviual flower?
