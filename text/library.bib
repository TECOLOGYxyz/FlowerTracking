abstract = {A lot of hype has recently been generated around deep learning, a group of artificial intelligence approaches able to break accuracy records in pattern recognition. Over the course of just a few years, deep learning revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics or medicine. Yet such a surge of tools and knowledge is still in its infancy in ecology despite the ever-growing size and the complexity of ecological datasets. Here we performed a literature review of deep learning implementations in ecology to identify its benefits in most ecological disciplines, even in applied ecology, up to decision makers and conservationists alike. We also provide guidelines on useful resources and recommendations for ecologists to start adding deep learning to their toolkit. At a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a necessity in ecology.},

abstract = {A central goal of animal ecology is to observe species in the natural world. The cost and challenge of data collection often limit the breadth and scope of ecological study. Ecologists often use image capture to bolster data collection in time and space. However, the ability to process these images remains a bottleneck. Computer vision can greatly increase the efficiency, repeatability and accuracy of image review. Computer vision uses image features, such as colour, shape and texture to infer image content. I provide a brief primer on ecological computer vision to outline its goals, tools and applications to animal ecology. I reviewed 187 existing applications of computer vision and divided articles into ecological description, counting and identity tasks. I discuss recommendations for enhancing the collaboration between ecologists and computer scientists and highlight areas for future growth of automated image analysis.},

@article{Agnarsson2006,
abstract = {Evolutionary "dead ends" result from traits that are selectively advantageous in the short term but ultimately result in lowered diversification rates of lineages. In spiders, 23 species scattered across eight families share a social system in which individuals live in colonies and cooperate in nest maintenance, prey capture, and brood care. Most of these species are inbred and have highly female-biased sex ratios. Here we show that in Theridiidae this social system originated eight to nine times independently among 11 to 12 species for a remarkable 18 to 19 origins across spiders. In Theridiidae, the origins cluster significantly in one clade marked by a possible preadaptation: extended maternal care. In most derivations, sociality is limited to isolated species: social species are sister to social species only thrice. To examine whether sociality in spiders represents an evolutionary dead end, we develop a test that compares the observed phylogenetic isolation of social species to the simulated evolution of social and non-social clades under equal diversification rates, and find that sociality in Theridiidae is significantly isolated. Because social clades are not in general smaller than their nonsocial sister clades, the "spindly" phylogenetic pattern-many tiny replicate social clades-may be explained by extinction rapid enough that a nonsocial sister group does not have time to diversify while the social lineage remains extant. In this case, this repeated origin and extinction of sociality suggests a conflict between the short-term benefits and long-term costs of inbred sociality. Although benefits of group living may initially outweigh costs of inbreeding (hence the replicate origins), in the long run the subdivision of the populations in relatively small and highly inbred colony lineages may result in higher extinction, thus an evolutionary dead end.},

abstract = {The extreme seasonality of the High Arctic creates very different flowering conditions for plants in areas of early and late snowmelt. Therefore, future reproductive responses to climate change may be dependent on the timing of snowmelt. We combined genetic, morphological, and long-term monitoring data on Dryas from a High Arctic hybrid zone of D. integrifolia and D. octopetala to assess whether climate variation influenced flowering differently in areas of early and late snowmelt, and whether this could have a genetic origin. We found a non-linear relationship between timing of snowmelt and flowering. The duration of the period between snowmelt and the onset of flowering (pre-floration interval) varied with the date of snowmelt. Shorter pre-floration intervals were associated with warmer average temperature during the pre-floration intervals in both early and late melting plots. However, the pre-floration interval was much shorter in early than in late plots at the same average temperature. Likewise, the interannual variation in flower abundance differed between early and late melting plots. Flower abundance was negatively influenced by frost after snowmelt in the year of flowering in early plots. In late plots, flower abundance was positively influenced by the length of the previous growing season. We identified two morpho-types in the study area, but their distribution and genetic differentiation was not related to the snowmelt gradient. We conclude that the different flowering responses found along the snowmelt gradient are a result of environmental variation. Based on our results and projected climatic change for the study area, we predict that the onset of flowering will advance and flower abundance will increase in areas of early snowmelt. In areas of late snowmelt, the onset of flowering will remain unchanged or be delayed and flower abundance will decrease.},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular technology have opened a new chapter in species conservation efforts, as well as population biology. DNA sequencing, MHC (major histocompatibility complex), minisatellite, microsatellite, and RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) procedures allow for identification of parentage, more distant relatives, founders to new populations, unidentified individuals, population structure, effective pop- ulation size, population-specific markers, etc. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplifi- cation of mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, ribosomal DNA, chloroplast DNA, and other systems provide for more sophisticated analyses of metapopulation structure, hybridization events, and delineation of species, subspecies, and races, all of which aid in setting species recovery priorities. Each technique can be powerful in its own right but is most credible when used in conjunction with other molecular techniques and, most importantly, with ecological and demographic data collected from the field. Surprisingly few taxa of concern have been assayed with any molecular technique. Thus, rather than showcasing exhaustive details from a few well-known examples, this paper attempts to present a broad range of cases in which molecular techniques have been used to provide insight into conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by a large number of genes and various environmental factors, such as light and temperature. The objective of this study was to identify flowering time quantitative trait loci (QTL) under growth conditions simulating seasonal conditions from native geographic locations. Our growth chambers were set to simulate the spring conditions in Spain and Sweden, with appropriate changes in light color, intensity and day length, as well as temperature and relative humidity. Thus the Sweden-like spring conditions changed more dramatically compared to Spain-like spring conditions across the duration of our experiment. We have used these conditions to map QTL responsible for flowering time in the Kas-1/Col-gl1 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) across two replicate blocks. A linkage map from 96 RILs was established using 119 markers including 64 new SNPs markers. One major QTL, mapping to the FRIGIDA (FRI) locus, was detected on the top of chromosome 4 that showed significant gene x seasonal environment interactions. Three other minor QTL also were detected. One QTL mapping near FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) showed an epistatic interaction with the QTL at FRI. These QTLxenvironment and QTL x QTL interactions suggest that subtle ecologically relevant changes in light, temperature, and relative humidity are differentially felt by alleles controlling flowering time and may be responsible for adaptation to regional environments.},

abstract = {Since the middle of the 1990s, parentage assignment using microsatellite markers has been introduced as a tool in aquaculture breeding. It now allows close to 100{\%} assignment success, and offered new ways to develop aquaculture breeding using mixed family designs in commercial conditions. Its main achievements are the knowledge and control of family representation and inbreeding, especially in mass spawning species, above all the capacity to estimate reliable genetic parameters in any species and rearing system with no prior investment in structures, and the development of new breeding programs in many species. Parentage assignment should not be seen as a way to replace physical tagging, but as a new way to conceive breeding programs, which have to be optimized with its specific constraints, one of the most important being to well define the number of individuals to genotype to limit costs, maximize genetic gain while minimizing inbreeding. The recent possible shift to (for the moment) more costly single nucleotide polymorphism markers should benefit from future developments in genomics and marker-assisted selection to combine parentage assignment and indirect prediction of breeding values.},

abstract = {Ecologists often study wildlife populations by deploying camera traps. Large datasets are generated using this approach which can be difficult for research teams to manually evaluate. Researchers increasingly enlist volunteers from the general public as citizen scientists to help classify images. The growing number of camera trap studies, however, makes it ever more challenging to find enough volunteers to process all projects in a timely manner. Advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, allow for accurate automatic image classification. By training models using existing datasets of images classified by citizen scientists and subsequent application of such models on new studies, human effort may be reduced substantially. The goals of this study were to (a) assess the accuracy of deep learning in classifying camera trap data, (b) investigate how to process datasets with only a few classified images that are generally difficult to model, and (c) apply a trained model on a live online citizen science project.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to differentiate among images of different animal species, images of humans or vehicles, and empty images (no animals, vehicles, or humans). We used four different camera trap datasets featuring a wide variety of species, different habitats, and a varying number of images. All datasets were labelled by citizen scientists on Zooniverse.
Accuracies for identifying empty images across projects ranged between 91.2{\%} and 98.0{\%}, whereas accuracies for identifying specific species were between 88.7{\%} and 92.7{\%}. Transferring information from CNNs trained on large datasets (“transfer‐learning”) was increasingly beneficial as the size of the training dataset decreased and raised accuracy by up to 10.3{\%}. Removing low‐confidence predictions increased model accuracies to the level of citizen scientists. By combining a trained model with classifications from citizen scientists, human effort was reduced by 43{\%} while maintaining overall accuracy for a live experiment running on Zooniverse.
Ecology researchers can significantly reduce image classification time and manual effort by combining citizen scientists and CNNs, enabling faster processing of data from large camera trap studies},

abstract = {A report about the evolution of sociality in the Felidae and other Carnivora. Five of the seven families of Canivora have evolved sociality. Canidae, Hyenidae and Felidae are discussed. Four hypotheses that affect sociality are discussed: H1: Defense against predation, H2: Nature of food resources favors grouping, H3:Intraspecific competition for critically limiting resources, H4: Interspecific competition for critically limiting resources (or for the cheetah: grouping is disfavored by interspecific competition). However efficient grouping for cheetahs is for capturing prey, in areas with abundant dominants the cost of theft may be too great for grouping to be favored. The conspicuousness of several adults should increase the frequency of theft by dominants. With few or no dominants, hunting efficiency should be sufficient to favor grouping (H2). Thus, in some areas where dominant abound, males must benefit from grouping because of intrasexual competition (H3), the advantages of which are probably sufficient to override the costs of interspecific competition (H4). Grouping by females could be favored because it reduces predation on infants by numerous, smaller predators (H1), by males (H3), and/or because foraging efficiency is enhanced. Intrasexual competition (H3), predation by species subordinate to adults (H1) and increased efficiency of foraging (H2) could account for increased grouping. All of these benefits would be enhanced by removal of interspecific competition from dominants. For example, with removal of the cheetah's dominants, numerous subordinate species should be favored and have higher densities. Last chapter is a reconstruction of social evolution.},

abstract = {One of the key members of the innate immune system in many vertebrate species is the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These molecules, which initiate the innate immune response and mount an anti-microbial response in both vertebrates and invertebrates, have recently been identified in the chicken genome. The recent findings of chicken TLRs (cTLRs) expression in ovarian follicles during follicular growth and in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infection are very important for reproductive physiology due to the transovarian transmission of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) in laying hens. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the ten cTLRs identified to date, in the chicken ovary in vivo and embryos during early embryonic development, to investigate whether sexual maturation affects their ovarian mRNA abundance and to investigate the transcriptional changes of TLRs in the chicken ovary in response to SE infection. RNA was extracted from embryos from day 3 to day 10 of embryonic development as well as from the ovaries of healthy prepubertal, sexually mature and aged birds, and from sexually mature and aged SE infected birds. RT-PCR analysis revealed that all TLRs apart from TLRs 1-1 and 2-2 were expressed in the ovary of sexually mature chickens, while all TLRs apart from TLR1-1 were expressed in the chicken embryos during embryonic development. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the ovarian mRNA abundance of TLRs differ with respect to sexual maturation. SE infection resulted in a significant induction of TLR4, and 15 in the ovary of sexual mature birds, and in a significant induction of TLR15 in the ovary of aged birds, while a significant down-regulation was observed for TLR3 in the ovary of aged birds. These findings suggest that a TLR-mediated immune response mechanism exists in the chicken ovary. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mechanism of sex determination varies substantively among evolutionary lineages. One important mode of genetic sex determination is haplodiploidy, which is used by approximately 20{\%} of all animal species, including {\textgreater}200,000 species of the entire insect order Hymenoptera. In the honey bee Apis mellifera, a hymenopteran model organism, females are heterozygous at the csd (complementary sex determination) locus, whereas males are hemizygous (from unfertilized eggs). Fertilized homozygotes develop into sterile males that are eaten before maturity. Because homozygotes have zero fitness and because common alleles are more likely than rare ones to form homozygotes, csd should be subject to strong overdominant selection and negative frequency-dependent selection. Under these selective forces, together known as balancing selection, csd is expected to exhibit a high degree of intraspecific polymorphism, with long-lived alleles that may be even older than the species. Here we sequence the csd genes as well as randomly selected neutral genomic regions from individuals of three closely related species, A. mellifera, Apis cerana, and Apis dorsata. The polymorphic level is approximately seven times higher in csd than in the neutral regions. Gene genealogies reveal trans-species polymorphisms at csd but not at any neutral regions. Consistent with the prediction of rare-allele advantage, nonsynonymous mutations are found to be positively selected in csd only in early stages after their appearances. Surprisingly, three different hypervariable repetitive regions in csd are present in the three species, suggesting variable mechanisms underlying allelic specificities. Our results provide a definitive demonstration of balancing selection acting at the honey bee csd gene, offer insights into the molecular determinants of csd allelic specificities, and help avoid homozygosity in bee breeding.},

abstract = {Differences in phenological responses to climate change among species can desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function. To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5–2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1–14.8 days earlier on average).},

Genetic variations at exon 2 of TLR4 gene in 14 chicken breeds and the red jungle fowl were detected by PCR-SSCP method and two alleles and three genotypes were found, Tibetan chicken and red jungle fowl only had BB genotype, while the others presented three genotypes of AA, BB and AB. Sequencing results showed two mutations, G114A and G142A, located at exon 2 of TLR4 gene. The results of Chi square test showed that all populations, except Xianju chicken, were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at this locus (P {\textgreater} 0.05). According to analysis of population genetic variation, all the populations were at moderate polymorphism (0.25 {\textless} PIC {\textless} 0.5) except red jungle fowl and Tibetan chicken (PIC = 0). The study demonstrated that there were differences of normal anti-disease ability in Chinese indigenous chicken breeds and appeared no significant correlation with body size, product type and geographical location. The associated analysis of results showed that the SNPs of TLR4 gene in the study were not linked with potential major loci or genes affecting some resistant traits.},

It presents some of the key facts, figures, concepts, and debates on international migration that appear in the arti- cles that follow, and outlines their main arguments. Five arguments in sup- port of greater international cooperation and more formal processes of global governance on international migration are presented here. First, contemporary international migration is now occurring at unprecedented levels and has a truly global reach. Second, international migration can no longer effectively bemanaged or controlled by nationalmigration policies, and greater international cooperation is required to achieve national goals in international migration. Third, there are growing numbers of migrants around the world who are vulnerable and exploited, and insufficiently pro- tected by either states or international institutions. Fourth, emerging struc- tural features in the global economy, alongside the effects of climate change, are likely to significantly increase the scale of internationalmigrationworld- wide, and present new management and protection challenges. Finally, mo- mentumfor change is slowly developing. KEYWORDS: internationalmigration, global governance.},

abstract = {TLRs comprise a family of evolutionary conserved sensory receptors that respond to distinct classes of ligands. For one major evolutionary branch of TLRs, the ligands are still largely unknown. Here we report the cloning and function of one member of this group, chicken TLR21 (chTLR21). This TLR is absent in the human species but has homologs in fish and frog and displays similarity with mouse TLR13. Expression of chTLR21 in HEK293 cells resulted in activation of NF-kappaB in response to unmethylated CpG DNA, typically recognized by mammalian TLR9. Silencing of chTLR21 (but not chTLR4) in chicken macrophages inhibited the response to CpG-DNA (but not to LPS), indicating similar functionality of the endogenous receptor. ChTLR21 responded to human- and murine-specific TLR9 ligands, as well as to bacterial genomic DNA isolated from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. Confocal microscopy located chTLR21 in the same intracellular compartments as human TLR9. Inhibition of the chTLR21 response by the endosomal maturation inhibitor chloroquine suggested that the receptor is functional in endolysosomes, as known for TLR9. The analogous localization and function of the phylogenetically only distantly related chTLR21 and mammalian TLR9 suggest that during evolution different classes of TLRs have emerged that recognize the same type of ligands.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need to reduce the uncertainties in remotely sensed detection of phenological shifts of high latitude ecosystems in response to climate changes in past decades. In this study, vegetation phenology in western Arctic Russia (the Yamal Peninsula) was investigated by analyzing and comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and SPOT-Vegetation (VGT) during the decade 2000–2010. The spatial patterns of key phenological parameters were highly heterogeneous along the latitudinal gradients based on multi-satellite data. There was earlier SOS (start of the growing season), later EOS (end of the growing season), longer LOS (length of the growing season), and greater MaxNDVI from north to south in the region. The results based on MODIS and VGT data showed similar trends in phenological changes from 2000 to 2010, while quite a different trend was found based on AVHRR data from 2000 to 2008. A significantly delayed EOS (p {\textless} 0.01), thus increasing the LOS, was found from AVHRR data, while no similar trends were detected from MODIS and VGT data. There were no obvious shifts in MaxNDVI during the last decade. MODIS and VGT data were considered to be preferred data for monitoring vegetation phenology in northern high latitudes. Temperature is still a key factor controlling spatial phenological gradients and variability, while anthropogenic factors (reindeer husbandry and resource exploitation) might explain the delayed SOS in southern Yamal. Continuous environmental damage could trigger a positive feedback to the delayed SOS.},

Insects are vectors of diseases that kill millions of people every year and, at the same time, insects pollinate most of the world's food production. Consequently, there is a demand for new devices able to control the populations of harmful insects while having a minimal impact on beneficial insects. In this paper, we present an intelligent trap that uses a laser sensor to selectively classify and catch insects. We perform an extensive evaluation of different feature sets from audio analysis and machine learning algorithms to construct accurate classifiers for the insect classification task. Support Vector Machines achieved the best results with a MFCC feature set, which consists of coefficients from frequencies scaled according to the human auditory system. We evaluate our classifiers in multiclass and binary class settings, and show that a binary class classifier that recognizes the mosquito species achieved almost perfect accuracy, assuring the applicability of the proposed intelligent trap.},

Due to an additional round of WGD, the rainbow trout genome offers a unique opportunity to investigate the early evolutionary fate of a duplicated vertebrate genome. Here we show that after 100 million years of evolution the two ancestral subgenomes have remained extremely collinear, despite the loss of half of the duplicated protein-coding genes, mostly through pseudogenization. In striking contrast is the fate of miRNA genes that have almost all been retained as duplicated copies. The slow and stepwise rediploidization process characterized here challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions.},

Here we describe the genome-wide pattern of LD in a sample of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions using 341,602 non-singleton SNPs. LD decays within 10 kb on average, considerably faster than previously estimated. Tag SNP selection algorithms and 'hide-the-SNP' simulations suggest that genome-wide association mapping will require only 40{\%}-50{\%} of the observed SNPs, a reduction similar to estimates in a sample of African Americans. An Affymetrix genotyping array containing 250,000 SNPs has been designed based on these results; we demonstrate that it should have more than adequate coverage for genome-wide association mapping. The extent of LD is highly variable, and we find clear evidence of recombination hotspots, which seem to occur preferentially in intergenic regions. LD also reflects the action of selection, and it is more extensive between nonsynonymous polymorphisms than between synonymous polymorphisms.},

Balancing selection acts on the MHC and could moderate the loss of variation expected from drift; however, in a Wisconsin population of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido), the number of MHC class II B alleles per individual declined by 44{\%} following a population bottleneck, compared to a loss of only 8{\%} at microsatellites. Simulations indicate that drift likely reduced MHC variation at the population level, as well as within individuals by reducing the number of gene copies per individual or by fixing the same alleles across multiple loci.

abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have provided some of the clearest examples of how natural selection generates discordances between adaptive and neutral variation in natural populations. The type and intensity of selection as well as the strength of genetic drift are believed to be important in shaping the resulting pattern of MHC diversity. However, evaluating the relative contribution of multiple microevolutionary forces is challenging, and empirical studies have reported contrasting results. For instance, balancing selection has been invoked to explain high levels of MHC diversity and low population differentiation in comparison with other nuclear markers. Other studies have shown that genetic drift can sometimes overcome selection and then patterns of genetic variation at adaptive loci cannot be discerned from those occurring at neutral markers. Both empirical and simulated data also indicate that loss of genetic diversity at adaptive loci can occur faster than at neutral loci when selection and population bottlenecks act simultaneously. Diversifying selection, on the other hand, explains accelerated MHC divergence as the result of spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selective regimes. Because of all these possible scenarios and outcomes, collecting information from as many study systems as possible, is crucial to enhance our understanding about the evolutionary forces driving MHC polymorphism. In this issue, Miller and co-workers present an illuminating contribution by combining neutral markers (microsatellites) and adaptive MHC class I loci during the investigation of genetic differentiation across island populations of tuatara Sphenodon punctatus. Their study of geographical variation reveals a major role of genetic drift in shaping MHC variation, yet they also discuss some support for diversifying selection.},

abstract = {The evolutionarily recent geographic expansion of humans, and the even more recent development of large, relatively dense human settlements, has exposed our species to new pathogenic environments. Potentially lethal pathogens are likely to have exerted important selective pressures on our genome, so immunity genes can be expected to show molecular signatures of the adaptation of human populations to these recent conditions. While genes related to the acquired immunity system have indeed been reported to show traces of local adaptation, little is known about the response of the innate immunity system. In this study, we analyze the variability patterns in different human populations of fifteen genes related to innate immunity. We have used both single nucleotide polymorphism and sequence data, and through the analysis of interpopulation differentiation, the linkage disequilibrium pattern, and intrapopulation diversity, we have discovered some signatures of positive and especially balancing selection in these genes, thus confirming the importance of the immune system genetic plasticity in the evolutionary adaptive process. Interestingly, the strongest evidence is found in three TLR genes and CD14. These innate immunity genes play a pivotal role, being involved in the primary recognition of pathogens. In general, more evidences of selection appear in the European populations, in some case possibly related to severe population specific pressures. However, we also describe evidence from African populations, which may reflect parallel or long-term selective forces acting in different geographic areas.},

abstract = {To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated ({\textgreater}1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.},

New technologies increase the pace at which humans and commodities can move around the world. Recent research on IAS at the global scale has examined commerce and travel in order to inform predictions, risk analyses, and policy. Due to limited data, regional-scale studies have primarily focused on invasion patterns rather than impacts. Local-scale experimental research can identify mechanisms and impacts of biological invasions, but the results may not be applicable at larger spatial scales. However, the number of information net works devoted to IAS is increasing globally and may help integrate 1AS research at all scales, particularly if data shar ing and compatibility can be improved. Integrating ecological and economic factors with trade analysis to explore the effectiveness of different approaches for preventing invasions is a promising approach at the global scale.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the phylogenetic history, genetic variation and ecological requirements of a species is important for its conservation and management. Unfortunately, for many species this information is lacking. Here we use multiple approaches (phylogenetics, population genetics and ecological modelling) to evaluate the evolutionary history and conservation status of Capra walie, an endangered flagship species of wild goat endemic to Ethiopia. The analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b and Y-chromosome DNA sequences suggests that C. walie forms a monophyletic clade with Capra nubiana, but potentially has been isolated for up to 0.8 million years from this closely related species. Microsatellite DNA analyses show that C. walie has very low genetic variation (mean heterozygosity=0.35) compared with other endangered mammals. This reduced variation likely derives from a prolonged demographic decline and small effective population size. Ecological niche modelling using the bioclimatic features of habitats occupied by C. walie, suggests ecological differences between C. walie and C. nubiana, and identifies the areas most suitable for future reintroductions of C. walie. The genetic and bioclimatic data suggest that C. walie is distinct and requires immediate conservation actions including genetic monitoring and reintroductions to establish independent populations. This study illustrates how combining noninvasive sampling along with genetic and ecological (bioclimatic) approaches can help assess conservation status of poorly known species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) perform a vital role in disease resistance through their recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recent advances in genomics allow comparison of TLR genes within and between many species. This study takes advantage of the recently sequenced chicken genome to determine the complete chicken TLR repertoire and place it in context of vertebrate genomic evolution. RESULTS: The chicken TLR repertoire consists of ten genes. Phylogenetic analyses show that six of these genes have orthologs in mammals and fish, while one is only shared by fish and three appear to be unique to birds. Furthermore the phylogeny shows that TLR1-like genes arose independently in fish, birds and mammals from an ancestral gene also shared by TLR6 and TLR10. All other TLRs were already present prior to the divergence of major vertebrate lineages 550 Mya (million years ago) and have since been lost in certain lineages. Phylogenetic analysis shows the absence of TLRs 8 and 9 in chicken to be the result of gene loss. The notable exception to the tendency of gene loss in TLR evolution is found in chicken TLRs 1 and 2, each of which underwent gene duplication about 147 and 65 Mya, respectively. CONCLUSION: Comparative phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate TLR genes provides insight into their patterns and processes of gene evolution, with examples of both gene gain and gene loss. In addition, these comparisons clarify the nomenclature of TLR genes in vertebrates.},

Shifts toward earlier seasonal activity are widespread; however, responses of insect phenology to warming are often more complex. Many species have prolonged their activity periods; others have shown delays. Furthermore, because of interspecific differences in temperature sensitivity, warming can increase or decrease synchronization between insects and their food plants and natural enemies. Here, I review recent findings in three areas — shifts in phenology, changes in voltinism, and altered species interactions — and highlight counterintuitive responses to warming caused by the particularities of insect life cycles. Throughout, I emphasize how an appreciation of the evolutionary processes shaping insect life histories is necessary to forecast changes in insect phenology and their demographic consequences.},

In many cases, a low level of immigration into small populations has produced fitness benefits that are greater than those predicted by theoretical models, resulting in what has been termed 'genetic rescue'. However, the opposite result (reduced fitness) can also be associated with immigration of genetically divergent individuals. Central to our understanding of genetic rescue are complex interactions among fundamental concepts in evolutionary and population biology, including both genetic and non-genetic (environmental, behavioral and demographic) factors. Developing testable models to predict when genetic rescue is likely to occur is a daunting challenge that will require carefully controlled, multi-generation experiments as well as creative use of information from natural 'experiments'.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are vital to activation of the innate immune system in response to invading pathogens through their recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin in vertebrates. In this study, we cloned the goose TLR5 gene using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The open reading frame (ORF) of goose TLR5 cDNA is 2583 bp in length and encodes an 860 amino acid protein. The entire coding region of the TLR5 gene was successfully amplified from genomic DNA and contained a single exon. The putative amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 consisted of a signal peptide sequence, 11 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal (LRR-CT) domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 shared 50.5{\%} identity with human (Homo sapiens), 49.8{\%} with mouse (Mus musculus) and 82.7{\%} with chicken (Gallus gallus). The goose TLR5 gene was highly expressed in the spleen, liver and brain: moderately expressed in PBMCs, kidney, lung, heart, bone marrow, small intestine and large intestine; and minimally expressed in the cecum. HEK293 cells transfected with goose TLR5 and NF-kappa B-luciferase containing plasmids significantly responded to flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium indicating that it is a functional TLR5 homologue. In response to infection with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE), the level of TLR5 mRNA significantly increased over the control in PBMCs at 1 d post infection (p.i.) and was slightly elevated in the spleen at 1 d or 3d p.i. IL-6 was expressed below control levels in PBMCs but was upregulated in the spleen. In contrast to IL-6, an evident decrease in the expression level of IL-8 was observed in both PBMCs and spleens at 1 d or 3d p.i. SE challenge also resulted in an increase in the mRNA expression of IL-18 and IFN-gamma in PBMCs and the spleen. These results imply that the expression of goose TLR5 is differentially regulated in various tissues and may participate in the immune response against bacterial pathogens. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While arctic flowers are visited by a wide range of insects, flies in family Muscidae have been proposed as a pollinator group of particular importance. To understand the functional outcome of current changes in pollinator community composition, we examined the role of muscids in the pollination of a key plant species, the mountain avens (Dryas). We monitored the seed set of Dryas across 15 sites at Zackenberg, northeast Greenland, and used sticky flower mimics and DNA barcoding to describe the flower-visiting community at each site. To evaluate the consequences of shifts in pollinator phenology under climate change, we compared the flower visitors between the early and the late season. Our approach revealed a diverse community of insects visiting Dryas, including two-thirds of all insect species known from the area. Even against this diverse background, the abundance of muscid flies emerged as a key predictor for seed set in Dryas, whereas overall insect abundance and species richness had little or no effect. With muscid flies as the main drivers of the pollinating function in the High Arctic, a recently observed decline in their abundances offers cause for concern.},

abstract = {Population viability might become compromised by the loss of genetic diversity and the accumulation of inbreeding resulting from population decline and fragmentation. The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) provides a paradigmatic example of a species at the verge of extinction, and because of the well-documented and different demographic histories of the two remaining populations (Do{\~{n}}ana and And{\'{u}}jar), it provides the opportunity to evaluate the performance of analytical methods commonly applied to recently declined populations. We used mitochondrial sequences and 36 microsatellite markers to evaluate the current genetic status of the species and to assess the genetic signatures of its past history. Mitochondrial diversity was extremely low with only two haplotypes, alternatively fixed in each population. Both remnant populations have low levels of genetic diversity at microsatellite markers, particularly the population from Do{\~{n}}ana, and genetic differentiation between the two populations is high. Bayesian coalescent-based methods suggest an earlier decline starting hundreds of years ago, while heterozygosity excess and M-ratio tests did not provide conclusive and consistent evidence for recent bottlenecks. Also, a model of gene flow received overwhelming support over a model of pure drift. Results that are in conflict with the known recent demography of the species call for caution in the use of these methods, especially when no information on previous demographic history is available. Overall, our results suggest that current genetic patterns in the Iberian lynx are mainly the result of its recent decline and fragmentation and alerts on possible genetic risks for its persistence. Conservation strategies should explicitly consider this threat and incorporate an integrated genetic management of wild, captive and re-introduced populations, including genetic restoration through translocations.},

We review so-called species tree methods and the biological forces that can undermine them by violating important aspects of the underlying models. Such forces include horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and natural selection. We review ways of detecting loci influenced by such forces and offer suggestions for identifying or accommodating them. The way forward involves identifying outlier loci, as is done in population genetic analysis of neutral and selected loci, and removing them from further analysis, or developing more complex species tree models that can accommodate such loci.},

abstract = {Innate immunity is expected to play a primary role in conferring resistance to novel infectious diseases, but few studies have attempted to examine its role in the evolution of resistance to emerging pathogens in wild vertebrate populations. Here, we used experimental infections and cDNA microarrays to examine whether changes in the innate and/or acquired immune responses likely accompanied the emergence of resistance in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in the eastern United States subject to a recent outbreak of conjunctivitis-causing bacterium (Mycoplasma gallisepticum-MG). Three days following experimental infection with MG, we observed differences in the splenic transcriptional responses between house finches from eastern U.S. populations, with a 12-year history of MG exposure, versus western U.S. populations, with no history of exposure to MG. In particular, western birds down-regulated gene expression, while eastern finches showed no expression change relative to controls. Studies involving poultry have shown that MG can manipulate host immunity, and our observations suggest that pathogen manipulation occurred only in finches from the western populations, outside the range of MG. Fourteen days after infection, eastern finches, but not western finches, up-regulated genes associated with acquired immunity (cell-mediated immunity) relative to controls. These observations suggest population differences in the temporal course of the response to infection with MG and imply that innate immune processes were targets of selection in response to MG in the eastern U.S. population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Profitability of breeding programs is a key determinant in the adoption of selective breeding, and can be evaluated using cost-benefit analysis. There are many options to design breeding programs, with or without a multiplier tier. Our objectives were to evaluate different breeding program designs for aquaculture and to optimize the number of selection candidates for these programs. METHODS: The baseline was based on an existing breeding program for gilthead seabream, where improvement of the nucleus had priority over improvement of the multiplier tier, which was partly replaced once every 3 years. Alternative breeding programs considered were annual multiplier tier replacement, annual multiplier tier replacement with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier, and a program without a multiplier tier. Cost-benefit analyses were performed to compare breeding programs. The outcomes were used to describe relationships between profitability and the number of selection candidates, length of the time horizon, and production output, and to estimate the optimum numbers of selection candidates. RESULTS: The baseline breeding program was profitable after 5 years and reached a net present value of 2.9 million euro in year 10. All alternative programs were more profitable up to year 17. The program without a multiplier tier was the most profitable one up to year 22, followed by the program with annual multiplier tier replacement and nucleus priority. The optimum number of selection candidates increased with the length of the time horizon and production output. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline breeding program was profitable after 5 years. For a short time horizon, putting priority on improvement of the multiplier tier over the nucleus is more profitable than putting priority on nucleus improvement, and vice versa for a long time horizon. Use of a multiplier tier increases the delay between costs made for selection and resulting benefits. Thus, avoiding the use of a multiplier tier will increase the profitability of the breeding program in the short term. The optimum number of selection candidates increases with the length of the time horizon and production output. Using too many selection candidates relative to the optimum leads to less reduction in profitability than using too few selection candidates. },

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The site frequency spectrum of mutations (SFS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) are the two major sources of information in population genetics studies. In this study we focus on the levels of LD and the SFS and on the effect of sample size on summary statistics in 10 Scandinavian populations of Norway spruce. We found that previous estimates of a low level of LD were highly influenced by both sampling strategy and the fact that data from multiple loci were analyzed jointly. Estimates of LD were in fact heterogeneous across loci and increased within individual populations compared with the estimate from the total data. The variation in levels of LD among populations most likely reflects different demographic histories, although we were unable to detect population structure by using standard approaches. As in previous studies, we also found that the SFS-based test Tajima's D was highly sensitive to sample size, revealing that care should be taken to draw strong conclusions from this test when sample size is small. In conclusion, the results from this study are in line with recent studies in other conifers that have revealed a more complex and variable pattern of LD than earlier studies suggested and with studies in trees and humans that suggest that Tajima's D is sensitive to sample size. This has large consequences for the design of future association and population genetic studies in Norway spruce.},

abstract = {The identification of signatures of natural selection in genomic surveys has become an area of intense research, stimulated by the increasing ease with which genetic markers can be typed. Loci identified as subject to selection may be functionally important, and hence (weak) candidates for involvement in disease causation. They can also be useful in determining the adaptive differentiation of populations, and exploring hypotheses about speciation. Adaptive differentiation has traditionally been identified from differences in allele frequencies among different populations, summarised by an estimate of FST. Low outliers relative to an appropriate neutral population-genetics model indicate loci subject to balancing selection, whereas high outliers suggest adaptive (directional) selection. However, the problem of identifying statistically significant departures from neutrality is complicated by confounding effects on the distribution of FST estimates, and current methods have not yet been tested in large-scale simulation experiments. Here, we simulate data from a structured population at many unlinked, diallelic loci that are predominantly neutral but with some loci subject to adaptive or balancing selection. We develop a hierarchical-Bayesian method, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assess its performance in distinguishing the loci simulated under selection from the neutral loci. We also compare this performance with that of a frequentist method, based on moment-based estimates of FST. We find that both methods can identify loci subject to adaptive selection when the selection coefficient is at least five times the migration rate. Neither method could reliably distinguish loci under balancing selection in our simulations, even when the selection coefficient is twenty times the migration rate.},

abstract = {We are currently experiencing unprecedented environmental changes driven by anthropogenic activities with consequences that include soil erosion, nutrient enrichment, population and species extinctions, and species invasions (Corlett, 2016). These rapid changes generate uncertainties that may compromise the goals and priorities of conservation and management efforts (Wiens and Hobbs, 2015), including rewilding attempts. Some conservationists, including rewilding advocates, subscribe to the ideal that natural processes should be allowed to take their course without human intervention. Others believe that such an approach is too risky so it is more appropriate to actively manage nature (Corlett, 2016). However, rewilding outcomes may become more unpredictable because of uncertainties in future conditions (e.g. climate change, land conversion) and increased frequency of extreme events. In this chapter, we focus on how trophic and passive rewilding initiatives may intensify the risk of unwanted ecological effects. We do not address potential economic and societal implications of rewilding initiatives because there are covered in other chapters (see Chapters 8, 9 and 19). In addition, we show that biological communities can be understood only by considering their evolutionary history, and we warn that ignoring this point in rewilding projects could ultimately risk failure.},

abstract = {Coevolution of efficient pollinators such as Bombus species (bumblebees) with the flowers they pollinate could make them spatially dependent on each other, thus affecting their distributions and abilities to colonize new areas. As Bombus species show a preference for blue-purple flowers, areas with a high diversity of Bombus species should correlate with a higher diversity of plants with blue-purple flowers. To investigate these relationships, we mapped flower colour distributions in the Arctic and tested for correlations with the richness of Bombus species and glacia-tion history. Regional occurrence and abundance of insect-pollinated species in the Arctic were obtained from the Panarctic Flora Checklist, and flower colour information for 526 species was retrieved from the literature, covering on average of 58{\%} of each regional flora. The number of Bombus species within each floristic region was approximated from published distribution maps. Our results support the prediction that Bombus species have preference for blue-purple flower colour and that (re)colonization of species with blue-purple flowers in heavily glaciated areas is partly constrained by pollinator deficiency. Plant species with white flowers showed an opposite trend in distribution to species with blue-purple flowers. Less pollinator dependency due to alternative reproduction modes may explain the high abundance of white-coloured flowers in Arctic regions, as pigment production without the benefit of pollination to offset the energy cost may reduce fitness under marginal arctic conditions.

Much early work that led to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for artificial systems was inspired by learning rules first developed in biology by Bush and Mosteller, and Rescorla and Wagner. More recently, temporal-difference RL, developed for learning in artificial agents, has provided a foundational framework for interpreting the activity of dopamine neurons. In this Review, we describe state-of-the-art work on RL in biological and artificial agents. We focus on points of contact between these disciplines and identify areas where future research can benefit from information flow between these fields. Most work in biological systems has focused on simple learning problems, often embedded in dynamic environments where flexibility and ongoing learning are important, similar to real-world learning problems faced by biological systems. In contrast, most work in artificial agents has focused on learning a single complex problem in a static environment. Moving forward, work in each field will benefit from a flow of ideas that represent the strengths within each discipline.},

abstract = {The microtopography associated with ice-wedge polygons governs many aspects of Arctic ecosystem, permafrost, and hydrologic dynamics from local to regional scales owing to the linkages between microtopography and the flow and storage of water, vegetation succession, and permafrost dynamics. Wide-spread ice-wedge degradation is transforming low-centered polygons into high-centered polygons at an alarming rate. Accurate data on spatial distribution of ice-wedge polygons at a pan-Arctic scale are not yet available, despite the availability of sub-meter-scale remote sensing imagery. This is because the necessary spatial detail quickly produces data volumes that hamper both manual and semi-automated mapping approaches across large geographical extents. Accordingly, transforming big imagery into 'science-ready' insightful analytics demands novel image-to-assessment pipelines that are fueled by advanced machine learning techniques and high-performance computational resources. In this exploratory study, we tasked a deep-learning driven object instance segmentation method (i.e., the Mask R-CNN) with delineating and classifying ice-wedge polygons in very high spatial resolution aerial orthoimagery. We conducted a systematic experiment to gauge the performances and interoperability of the Mask R-CNN across spatial resolutions (0.15 m to 1 m) and image scene contents (a total of 134 km2) near Nuiqsut, Northern Alaska. The trained Mask R-CNN reported mean average precisions of 0.70 and 0.60 at thresholds of 0.50 and 0.75, respectively. Manual validations showed that approximately 95{\%} of individual ice-wedge polygons were correctly delineated and classified, with an overall classification accuracy of 79{\%}. Our findings show that the Mask R-CNN is a robust method to automatically identify ice-wedge polygons from fine-resolution optical imagery. Overall, this automated imagery-enabled intense mapping approach can provide a foundational framework that may propel future pan-Arctic studies of permafrost thaw, tundra landscape evolution, and the role of high latitudes in the global climate system.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Arctic plants will experience both higher temperatures and changes to their pollination regime under future climate change scenarios. However, reproductive responses to pollination, warming, and a pollination– warming interaction likely vary with seasonal timing in phenology, and may be more pronounced in earlyflowering plants than later-flowering plants. To test these hypotheses, we applied hand pollination and exclusion treatments to three Arctic plant species (early-flowering Salix arctica Pall., mid-season flowering Dryas integrifolia Vahl, and late-flowering Papaver radicatum Rottb.) inside and outside of open-top chambers (OTCs), to determine how pollination and warming may interact. We found that OTCs did not significantly reduce visitation by insects, nor did they reduce seed production in wind-pollinated S. arctica. Flower production and seed germination rates for D. integrifolia matched the predictions for warmth- and pollen-limited plants. Reproduction in P. radicatum did not respond strongly to either warming or pollination. Overall, we found that High Arctic plant reproduction is affected independently by pollination and OTC warming, indicating that plant responses to ongoing increases in temperature will not be strongly altered by changes in insect pollination.},

abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) forms an integral component of the vertebrate immune response and, due to strong selection pressures, is one of the most polymorphic regions of the entire genome. Despite over 15 years of research, empirical studies offer highly contradictory explanations of the relative roles of different evolutionary forces, selection and genetic drift, acting on MHC genes during population bottlenecks. Here, we take a meta-analytical approach to quantify the results of studies into the effects of bottlenecks on MHC polymorphism. We show that the consequences of selection acting on MHC loci prior to a bottleneck event, combined with drift during the bottleneck, will result in overall loss of MHC polymorphism that is ∼15{\%} greater than loss of neutral genetic diversity. These results are counter to general expectations that selection should maintain MHC polymorphism, but do agree with the results of recent simulation models and at least two empirical studies. Notably, our results suggest that negative frequency-dependent selection could be more important than overdominance for maintaining high MHC polymorphism in pre-bottlenecked populations.},

Using plasticine models in the field, we show that the light coat color of deer mice that recently colonized the light-colored soil of the Nebraska Sand Hills provides a strong selective advantage against visually hunting predators. Color variation in an admixed population suggests that this light Sand Hills phenotype is composed of multiple traits. We identified distinct regions within the Agouti locus associated with each color trait and found that only haplotypes associated with light trait values have evidence of selection. Thus, local adaptation is the result of independent selection on many mutations within a single locus, each with a specific effect on an adaptive phenotype, thereby minimizing pleiotropic consequences.},

abstract = {Phenological shifts linked to global warming reflect the ability of organisms to track changing climatic conditions. However, different organisms track global warming differently and there is an increasing interest in the link between phenological traits and plant abundance and distribution. Long-term data sets are often used to estimate phenological traits to climate change, but so far little has been done to evaluate the quality of these estimates. Here, we use a 73-year long data series of first flowering dates for 25 species from north-temperate Sweden to evaluate (i) correlations between first flowering dates and year for different time periods and (ii) linear regression models between first flowering date and mean monthly temperatures in preceding months. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential of this kind of data to estimate the phenological temperature sensitivities (i.e. number of days phenological change per degree temperature change, $\beta$(60)) in such models. The sign of the correlations between first flowering dates and year were highly inconsistent among different time periods, highlighting that estimates of phenological change are sensitive to the specific time period used. The first flowering dates of all species were correlated with temperature, but with large differences in both the strength of the response and the period(s) of the year that were most strongly associated with phenological variation. Finally, our analyses indicated that legacy data sets need to be relatively long-term to be useful for estimating phenological temperature sensitivities ($\beta$(60)) for inter-specific comparisons. In 10-year long observation series only one out of 24 species reached ≥80 {\%} probability of estimating temperature sensitivity ($\beta$(60)) within a ±1 range, and 17 out of 24 species reached ≥80 {\%} probability when observation series were 20 years or shorter. The standard error for $\beta$(60) ranged from 0.6 to 2.0 for 10-year long observation series, and 19 out of 24 species reached SE {\textless} 1 after 15 years. In general, late flowering species will require longer time series than early flowering species.},

abstract = {Among the major goals of research in evolutionary biology are the identification of genes targeted by natural selection and understanding how various regimes of evolution affect the fitness of an organism. In particular, adaptive evolution enables organisms to adapt to changing ecological factors such as diet, temperature, habitat, predatory pressures and prey abundance. An integrative approach is crucial for the identification of non-synonymous mutations that introduce radical changes in protein biochemistry and thus in turn influence the structure and function of proteins. Performing such analyses manually is often a time-consuming process, due to the large number of statistical files generated from multiple approaches, especially when assessing numerous taxa and/or large datasets. We present IMPACT{\_}S, an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) software, which rapidly and effectively integrates, filters and combines results from three widely used programs for assessing the influence of selection: Codeml (PAML package), Datamonkey and TreeSAAP. It enables the identification and tabulation of sites detected by these programs as evolving under the influence of positive, neutral and/or negative selection in protein-coding genes. IMPACT{\_}S further facilitates the automatic mapping of these sites onto the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Other useful tools incorporated in IMPACT{\_}S include Jmol, Archaeopteryx, Gnuplot, PhyML, a built-in Swiss-Model interface and a PDB downloader. The relevance and functionality of IMPACT{\_}S is shown through a case study on the toxicoferan-reptilian Cysteine-rich Secretory Proteins (CRiSPs).

abstract = {Fillet yield (i.e. the proportion of edible flesh from a given amount of fish) is a trait of high economic interest for species sold as fillets. Improving it by selective breeding is not an easy task, as it is a ratio trait, which causes mathematical difficulties. It is moreover a specific ratio where numerator (fillet weight) and denominator (body weight) are very strongly correlated (genetic and phenotypic correlations in the range 0.89–0.99). This led some authors to conclude that they have the same genetic and phenotypic basis, precluding selection for improved fillet yield. In this study, we propose to study fillet yield as a component of two traits, fillet weight and waste weight (waste weight = body weight-fillet weight, so the sum of head, bones, fins and viscera weight), which we expect to be less correlated. Using data from 5 batches of fish from 3 species (sea bass, sea bream, rainbow trout), we show that as expected, fillet weight and waste weight are less correlated than fillet weight and body weight (on average, rA= 0.91 and rP= 0.88 vs. rA= 0.987, rP= 0.981). We used stochastic simulation to generate genotypes and phenotypes of fish using those genetic parameters for fillet weight and waste weight. We simulated 10 generations of selection for increased fillet yield using nine selection indices. Five indices had rather similar performances, residual fillet weight (the residual of the regression of fillet weight to body weight), fillet yield, fillet to waste ratio, restricted selection index (a linear index aimed at improving fillet weight while keeping waste weight constant) and linear index (optimized to improve fillet/waste ratio). With these indices, the average selection gain was + 0.66{\%} of fillet yield per generation (range 0.30 to 0.95{\%} using real genetic parameters from 5 fish batches). Selection for the difference between fillet weight and waste weight was 30{\%} less efficient, while selection for increased fillet weight or increased body weight was 55–65{\%} less efficient. Selection against waste weight had a null or even negative impact on fillet yield. Factors favorable to higher selection gains are low initial fillet yield, different heritabilities and CVs of fillet weight and waste weight, low genetic correlation and high phenotypic correlation of fillet weight and waste weight. These results suggest that although fillet weight and body weight are strongly correlated and proportional to each other, moderate selection gains on fillet yield are possible. We consider it would be useful to add waste weight in the parameters recorded in future genetic studies on fillet yield.},

This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reconstructing phylogenies from intraspecific data (such as human mitochondrial DNA variation) is often a challenging task because of large sample sizes and small genetic distances between individuals. The resulting multitude of plausible trees is best expressed by a network which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form of cycles. We present a method ("median joining" [MJ]) for constructing networks from recombination-free population data that combines features of Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees by favoring short connections, and Farris's maximum-parsimony (MP) heuristic algorithm, which sequentially adds new vertices called "median vectors", except that our MJ method does not resolve ties. The MJ method is hence closely related to the earlier approach of Foulds, Hendy, and Penny for estimating MP trees but can be adjusted to the level of homoplasy by setting a parameter epsilon. Unlike our earlier reduced median (RM) network method, MJ is applicable to multistate characters (e.g., amino acid sequences). An additional feature is the speed of the implemented algorithm: a sample of 800 worldwide mtDNA hypervariable segment I sequences requires less than 3 h on a Pentium 120 PC. The MJ method is demonstrated on a Tibetan mitochondrial DNA RFLP data set.},

abstract = {Historical factors, current population size, population connectivity and selective processes at linked loci contribute to shaping contemporary patterns of neutral genetic diversity. It is now widely acknowledged that nuclear and mitochondrial markers react differently to current demography as well as to past history, so the use of both types of markers is often advocated to gain insight on both historical and contemporary processes. We used 12 microsatellite loci genotyped in 13 populations of a mountain lizard (Iberolacerta bonnali) to test whether the historical scenario favoured by a previous mitochondrial study was also supported by nuclear markers and thereby evaluated the consequences of postglacial range movements on nuclear diversity. Congruent signals of recent history were revealed by nuclear and mitochondrial markers using an Approximate Bayesian computation approach, but contemporary patterns of mtDNA and nuclear DNA diversity were radically different. Although dispersal in this species is probably highly restricted at all spatial scales, colonization abilities have been historically good, suggesting capability for reestablishment of locally extinct populations except in fully disconnected habitats.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genomic selection (GS) allows estimation of the breeding value of individuals, even for non-phenotyped animals. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of identity-by-descent genomic selection (IBD-GS) in genomic selection for a binary, sib-evaluated trait, using different strategies of selective genotyping. This low-cost GS approach is based on linkage analysis of sparse genome-wide marker loci. FINDINGS Lowly to highly heritable (h(2) = 0.15, 0.30 or 0.60) binary traits with varying incidences (10 to 90{\%}) were simulated for an aquaculture-like population. Genotyping was restricted to the 30{\%} best families according to phenotype, using three genotyping strategies for training sibs. IBD-GS increased genetic gain compared to classical pedigree-based selection; the differences were largest at incidences of 10 to 50{\%} of the desired category (i.e. a relative increase in genetic gain greater than 20{\%}). Furthermore, the relative advantage of IBD-GS increased as the heritability of the trait increased. Differences were small between genotyping strategies, and most of the improvement was achieved by restricting genotyping to sibs with the least common binary phenotype. Genetic gains of IBD-GS relative to pedigree-based models were highest at low to moderate (10 to 50{\%}) incidences of the category selected for, but decreased substantially at higher incidences (80 to 90{\%}). CONCLUSIONS The IBD-GS approach, combined with sparse and selective genotyping, is well suited for genetic evaluation of binary traits. Genetic gain increased considerably compared with classical pedigree-based selection. Most of the improvement was achieved by selective genotyping of the sibs with the least common (minor) binary category phenotype. Furthermore, IBD-GS had greater advantage over classical pedigree-based models at low to moderate incidences of the category selected for.},

abstract = {Camera traps are a widely used tool in wildlife research and conservation, but in situ factors such as theft, poor performance in extreme environments and damage by wildlife may be hindering the effectiveness of the technology. How- ever, we still know little about how widespread these constraints are and which are the priorities to solve in the short- and mid-term. We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66{\%}, 50{\%} and 42{\%} of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trap- ping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera- trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near- future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data. Ultimately, this will increase the capacity of researchers and conservationists to implement coordinated wildlife monitoring at unprece- dented scales.},

abstract = {The ability of natural populations to adapt to new environmental conditions is crucial for their survival and partly determined by the standing genetic variation in each population. Populations with higher genetic diversity are more likely to contain individuals that are better adapted to new circumstances than populations with lower genetic diversity. Here, we use both neutral and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) markers to test whether small and highly fragmented populations hold lower genetic diversity than large ones. We use black grouse as it is distributed across Europe and found in populations with varying degrees of isolation and size. We sampled 11 different populations; five continuous, three isolated, and three small and isolated. We tested patterns of genetic variation in these populations using three different types of genetic markers: nine microsatellites and 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which both were found to be neutral, and two functional MHC genes that are presumably under selection. The small isolated populations displayed significantly lower neutral genetic diversity compared to continuous populations. A similar trend, but not as pronounced, was found for genotypes at MHC class II loci. Populations were less divergent at MHC genes compared to neutral markers. Measures of genetic diversity and population genetic structure were positively correlated among microsatellites and SNPs, but none of them were correlated to MHC when comparing all populations. Our results suggest that balancing selection at MHC loci does not counteract the power of genetic drift when populations get small and fragmented.},

The survival advantage gained through adding this type of adaptive immune system to a pre-existing innate immune system led to the evolution of alternative ways for lymphocytes to generate diverse antigen receptors for use in recognizing and repelling pathogen invaders. All jawed vertebrates assemble their antigen-receptor genes through recombinatorial rearrangement of different immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene segments. The surviving jawless vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead solved the receptor diversification problem by the recombinatorial assembly of leucine-rich-repeat genetic modules to encode variable lymphocyte receptors. The convergent evolution of these remarkably different adaptive immune systems involved innovative genetic modification of innate-immune-system components. ??2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this chapter we discuss how images are formed and captured, the first step in robot and human perception of the world. From images we can deduce the size, shape and position of objects in the world as well as other characteristics such as color and texture. It has long been known that a simple pin-hole is able to create a perfect inverted image on the wall of a darkened room. Some marine molluscs, for example the Nautilus, have pin-hole camera eyes. All vertebrates have a lens that forms an inverted image on the retina where the light-sensitive cells rod and cone cells, shown previously in Fig. 10.6, are arranged. A digital camera is similar in principle - a glass or plastic lens forms an image on the surface of a semiconductor chip with an array of light sensitive devices to convert light to a digital image. The process of image formation, in an eye or in a camera, involves a projection of the 3-dimensional world onto a 2-dimensional surface. The depth information is lost and we can no longer tell from the image whether it is of a large object in the distance or a smaller closer object. This transformation from 3 to 2 dimensions is known as perspective projection and is discussed in Sect. 11.1. Section 11.2 introduces the topic of camera calibration, the estimation of the parameters of the perspective transformation. In Sect. 11.2.3 we discuss the inverse problem, how to reconstruct 3-dimensional world points given a 2-dimensional image. Section 11.3 introduces alternative types of cameras capable of wide-angle or panoramic imaging.},

Despite these predictions, evidence from genomic data does not suggest a significant reduction in the efficacy of selection associated with high levels of self-fertilization. Here,wediscuss opportunities for selfing populations to avoid an irreversible decline in fitness toward extinction and the implications for ge- nome evolution. Most directly, large population sizes and the purging of deleterious recessive mutations can reduce genetic loadsandslow the effects of genetic drift. Theorysuggests that recombination ratesmayalso evolve in response to the evolution of mating system, which can offset the harmful effects of inbreeding. Cytological data supporting the evolution of higher recombination rates in selfing species should be supplemented with genetic and molecular methods for estimating this parameter. Mutation ratesmayalso evolve to be higher in selfing plants as a result of hitchhiking with advantageous mutations, although this is unlikely to lead to increased fitness. Finally, the abundance and activity of selfish genetic elements may also be reduced in selfing lineages, reducing the accu- mulation of transposable elements, B chromosomes, biased gene conversion, and the spread of cytoplasmic male sterility mutations. This reduction in genomic conflict can increase mean fitness, reduce deleterious mutation rates, and reduce genome size. We show, using comparative data, that highly selfing plants have genomes sig- nificantly smaller than those of outcrossing relatives, consistent with reduced activity and spread of repetitive elements in inbred plants.We discuss opportunities for tests of theory as plant genomic data accumulate andargue that a genomic perspective on reproductive transitions in a phylogenetic context should provide important in- sights into the diversity of reproductive systems in flowering plants},

abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been put forward as a model for studying how genetic diversity is maintained in wild populations. Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is believed to generate the extraordinary levels of MHC diversity observed. However, establishing the relative importance of the three proposed mechanisms of PMS (heterozygote advantage, rare-allele advantage and fluctuating selection) has proved extremely difficult. Studies have attempted to differentiate between mechanisms of PMS using two approaches: (i) comparing MHC diversity with that expected under neutrality and (ii) relating MHC diversity to pathogen regime. Here, we show that in many cases the same predictions arise from the different mechanisms under these approaches, and that most studies that have inferred one mechanism of selection have not fully considered the alternative explanations. We argue that, while it may be possible to demonstrate that particular mechanisms of PMS are occurring, resolving their relative importance within a system is probably impossible. A more realistic target is to continue to demonstrate when and where the different mechanisms of PMS occur, with the aim of determining their relative importance across systems. We put forward what we believe to be the most promising approaches that will allow us to progress towards achieving this.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases have been paramount among the threats to health and survival throughout human evolutionary history. Natural selection is therefore expected to act strongly on host defense genes, particularly on innate immunity genes whose products mediate the direct interaction between the host and the microbial environment. In insects and mammals, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) appear to play a major role in initiating innate immune responses against microbes. In humans, however, it has been speculated that the set of TLRs could be redundant for protective immunity. We investigated how natural selection has acted upon human TLRs, as an approach to assess their level of biological redundancy. We sequenced the ten human TLRs in a panel of 158 individuals from various populations worldwide and found that the intracellular TLRs -- activated by nucleic acids and particularly specialized in viral recognition -- have evolved under strong purifying selection, indicating their essential non-redundant role in host survival. Conversely, the selective constraints on the TLRs expressed on the cell surface -- activated by compounds other than nucleic acids -- have been much more relaxed, with higher rates of damaging nonsynonymous and stop mutations tolerated, suggesting their higher redundancy. Finally, we tested whether TLRs have experienced spatially-varying selection in human populations and found that the region encompassing TLR10-TLR1-TLR6 has been the target of recent positive selection among non-Africans.

abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via "SNP chip" microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

abstract = {Reliability of genomic selection (GS) models was tested in an admixed population of Atlantic salmon, originating from crossing of several wild subpopulations. The models included ordinary genomic BLUP models (GBLUP), using genome-wide SNP markers of varying densities (1-220 k), a genomic identity-by-descent model (IBD-GS), using linkage analysis of sparse genome-wide markers, as well as a classical pedigree-based model. Reliabilities of the models were compared through 5-fold cross-validation. The traits studied were salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) resistance (LR), measured as (log) density on the skin and fillet color (FC), with respective estimated heritabilities of 0.14 and 0.43. All genomic models outperformed the classical pedigree-based model, for both traits and at all marker densities. However, the relative improvement differed considerably between traits, models and marker densities. For the highly heritable FC, the IBD-GS had similar reliability as GBLUP at high marker densities ({\textgreater}22 k). In contrast, for the lowly heritable LR, IBD-GS was clearly inferior to GBLUP, irrespective of marker density. Hence, GBLUP was robust to marker density for the lowly heritable LR, but sensitive to marker density for the highly heritable FC. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be explained by historical admixture of different founder populations, expected to reduce short-range lice density (LD) and induce long-range LD. The relative importance of LD/relationship information is expected to decrease/increase with increasing heritability of the trait. Still, using the ordinary GBLUP, the typical long-range LD of an admixed population may be effectively captured by sparse markers, while efficient utilization of relationship information may require denser markers (e.g., 22 k or more).},

Our monitoring system focuses on observing the honeybees as naturally as possible (i.e. without disturbing the honeybees). It is based on the Raspberry Pi that is a low-cost embedded computer with very limited computational resources as compared to an ordinary PC. The system succeeds in counting honeybees, identifying their position and measuring their in-and-out activity. Our algorithm uses background subtraction method to segment the images. After the segmentation stage, the methods are primarily based on statistical analysis and inference. The regression statistics (i.e. R2) of the comparisons of system predictions and manual counts are 0.987 for counting honeybees, and 0.953 and 0.888 for measuring in-activity and out-activity, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that this system can be used as a tool to detect the behaviour of honeybees and assess their state in the beehive entrance. Besides, the result of the computation time show that the Raspberry Pi is a viable solution in such real-time video processing system.},

abstract = {Despite uncertainties in the magnitude of expected global warming over the next century, one consistent feature of extant and projected changes is that Arctic environments are and will be exposed to the greatest warming [1]. Concomitant with such large abiotic changes, biological responses to warming at high northern latitudes are also expected to outpace those at lower latitudes. One of the clearest and most rapid signals of biological response to rising temperatures across an array of biomes has been shifts in species phenology [2-4], yet to date evidence for phenological responses to climate change has been presented from most biomes except the High Arctic [3]. Given the well-established consequences for population dynamics of shifts in the timing of life history events [5,6], it is essential that the High Arctic be represented in assessments of phenological response to climate change. Using the most comprehensive data set available from this region, we document extremely rapid climate-induced advancement of flowering, emergence and egg-laying in a wide array of species in a high-arctic ecosystem. The strong responses and the large variability within species and taxa illustrate how easily biological interactions may be disrupted by abiotic forcing, and how dramatic responses to climatic changes can be for arctic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

In the present study, the expression profile of chicken TLRs (TLR2A, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15, and TLR21) in various chicken embryonic tissues during embryo development was examined by real-time PCR assay. All the TLR mRNAs were expressed in whole embryonic tissue as early as 3rd embryonic day (ED). Four of the seven TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7) mRNA expressions were significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher at 12ED relative to expression at 3 ED, whereas TLR15 mRNA expression was significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher on 7ED and TLR5 and 21 were highly expressed on 18 ED. Among all the TLRs investigated TLR4 mRNA was the highest expressed and TLR15 mRNA expression was the lowest in all tissues during chicken embryo development. Tissue wise analysis of mRNA expression of TLRs showed that liver expressed significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher levels of most of the genes (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR21).

Identifying adaptive divergence between closely-related species can provide important insights into the processes that may have contributed to these spectacular radiations. Here, we studied a pair of sympatric Lake Malawi species, Pseudotropheus fainzilberi and P. emmiltos, whose reproductive isolation depends on olfactory communication. We tested the hypothesis that these species have undergone divergent selection at MHC class II genes, which are known to contribute to olfactory-based mate choice in other taxa.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Divergent selection on functional alleles was inferred from the higher genetic divergence at putative antigen binding sites (ABS) amino acid sequences than at putatively neutrally evolving sites at intron 1, exon 2 synonymous sequences and exon 2 amino acid residues outside the putative ABS. In addition, sympatric populations of these fish species differed significantly in communities of eukaryotic parasites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that local host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics may have driven adaptive divergence in MHC alleles, influencing odor-mediated mate choice and leading to reproductive isolation. These results provide the first evidence for a novel mechanism of adaptive speciation and the first evidence of adaptive divergence at the MHC in closely related African cichlid fishes.},

We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.},

However, due to the difficulties faced in producing adequately replicated samples and in controlling for confounding variables, prior attempts to examine evolutionary questions relating to habitat area and population size have produced equivocal results. Here we show, using experimental design criteria that reduce the potential for such confounding, that bird species on larger landmasses have higher rates of molecular evolution. The study involves a global dataset of 48 independent contrasts for the cytochrome b gene encompassing all possible paired sister species comparisons (from seven orders and 17 families) that were available at the time of dataset assembly. A more rapid evolutionary tempo in larger areas has important ramifications for biodiversity conservation because it indicates a new imperative, beyond that of simply maintaining preexisting genetic diversity, for securing large areas for threatened species. This result suggests that the trend of confining species to limited refugia is likely to be slowing the tempo of microevolution. That effect might constrain the potential for adaptive shifts in response to changing environments such as those associated with global warming.},

abstract = {Ongoing climate change has affected the ecological dynamics of many species and is expected to impose natural selection on ecologically important traits. Droughts and other anticipated changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought. Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestorxdescendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestorxdescendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations. A systematic effort to collect and store propagules from suitable species would provide biologists with materials to detect and elucidate the genetic basis of further evolutionary shifts driven by climate change.},

abstract = {Rapid anthropogenic environmental change is altering selection pressures on natural plant populations. However, it is difficult to predict easily the novel selection pressures to which populations will be exposed. There is heavy reliance on plant genetic diversity for future crop security in agriculture and industry, but the implications of genetic diversity for natural populations receives less attention. Here, we examine the links between the genetic diversity of natural populations and aspects of plant performance and fitness. We argue that accumulating evidence demonstrates the future benefit or 'option value' of genetic diversity within natural populations when subject to anthropogenic environmental changes. Consequently, the loss of that diversity will hinder their ability to adapt to changing environments and is, therefore, of serious concern. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: We tested the hypothesis that optimum-contribution selection (OCS) with restrictions imposed during optimisation realises most of the long-term genetic gain realised by OCS without restrictions. Methods: We used stochastic simulation to estimate long-term rates of genetic gain realised by breeding schemes that applied OCS without and with restrictions imposed during optimisation, where long-term refers to generations 23 to 25 (approximately). Six restrictions were imposed. Five of these removed solutions from the solution space. The sixth removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. We also simulated a conventional breeding scheme with truncation selection as a reference point. Generations overlapped, selection was for a single trait, and the trait was observed for all selection candidates prior to selection. Results: OCS with restrictions realised 67 to 99{\%} of the additional gain realised by OCS without restrictions, where additional gain was the difference in the long-term rates of genetic gain realised by OCS without restrictions and our reference point with truncation selection. The only exceptions were those restrictions that removed all solutions near the optimum solution from the solution space and the restriction that removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. Imposing these restrictions realised only −12 to 46{\%} of the additional gain. Conclusions: Most of the long-term genetic gain realised by OCS without restrictions can be realised by OCS with restrictions imposed during optimisation, provided the restrictions do not remove all solutions near the optimum from the solution space and do not remove records of earlier selection decisions. In breeding schemes where OCS cannot be applied optimally because of biological and logistical restrictions, OCS with restrictions provides a useful alternative. Not only does it realise most of the long-term genetic gain, OCS with restrictions enables OCS to be tailored to individual breeding schemes.},

abstract = {Themottled duck (Anas fulvigula) is a year-round endemic resident of the Gulf Coast and one of two non-migratory dabbling ducks that inhabit North America. To investigate population genetic structure of allopatric mottled duck populations, we collected 5' control region sequences (bp 78–774) from the mitochondria of 219 mottled ducks sampled at 11 widely spaced geographic localities in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida and compared them to each other and to homologous sequences from 4 Mexican ducks (A. diazi), 13 American black ducks (A. rubripes), and 10 mallards (A. platyrhynchos). We identified 57 unique haplotypes composed of 665 or 666 nucleotides in the 246 control region sequences. Of the 665 homologous positions, 8.3{\%} (n = 55) vary among haplotypes, and 98.2{\%} (n = 54) of these occur within the first 351 nucleotides from the 5' end of the outgroup sequence. Neighbor-joining analysis shows a large distal clade (52.5{\%} of mottled ducks sampled in our study) composed of two reciprocally monophyletic clades of mottled duck haplotypes, one of which is endemic to Texas and Louisiana and the other endemic to Florida. No mottled ducks sampled in Florida occur in the clade composed of mottled ducks from Texas and Louisiana or vice versa, suggesting that (1) an enduring geographic split has existed for many years between east and west, and (2) gene flow currently is non-existent (or at least undetectable) across the central Gulf Coast. The remaining 47.5{\%} of mottled ducks sampled in our study branch basally from this derived clade, show substantially less hierarchical structure, and fall into various lineage groups of mixed species composition with no geographic or species-specific pattern. Pairwise FST values corroborate the pattern of strong differentiation observed between Texas/Louisiana and Florida. Our findings are consistent with a pattern of partial lineage sorting from a polymorphic ancestral gene pool reshuffled by hybridizing mallards. Control region data and patterns of divergence in mallard-like species worldwide, furthermore, suggest that mottled ducks are close relatives ofMexican ducks, and in turn nested within black ducks. Genetic similarities to nominatemallards are less likely to be the product of common ancestry, but the result of past hybridizationwith a dichromatic mallard ancestor that invaded North America from Asia many generations ago. Our findings have several important consequences for the conservation biology of mottled ducks across the Gulf Coast and our understanding of the phylogeography of mallard-like species worldwide.},

Here we present the assembled genome of the social velvet spider and a draft assembly of the tarantula genome that represent two major taxonomic groups of spiders. The spider genomes are large with short exons and long introns, reminiscent of mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic analyses place spiders and ticks as sister groups supporting polyphyly of the Acari. Complex sets of venom and silk genes/proteins are identified. We find that venom genes evolved by sequential duplication, and that the toxic effect of venom is most likely activated by proteases present in the venom. The set of silk genes reveals a highly dynamic gene evolution, new types of silk genes and proteins, and a novel use of aciniform silk. These insights create new opportunities for pharmacological applications of venom and biomaterial applications of silk.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3] , our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

abstract = {DNA from bacteria has stimulatory effects on mammalian immune cells, which depend on the presence of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in the bacterial DNA. In contrast, mammalian DNA has a low frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and these are mostly methylated; therefore, mammalian DNA does not have immuno-stimulatory activity. CpG DNA induces a strong T-helper-1-like inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence has revealed the therapeutic potential of CpG DNA as adjuvants for vaccination strategies for cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. Despite its promising clinical use, the molecular mechanism by which CpG DNA activates immune cells remains unclear. Here we show that cellular response to CpG DNA is mediated by a Toll-like receptor, TLR9. TLR9-deficient (TLR9-/-) mice did not show any response to CpG DNA, including proliferation of splenocytes, inflammatory cytokine production from macrophages and maturation of dendritic cells. TLR9-/- mice showed resistance to the lethal effect of CpG DNA without any elevation of serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The in vivo CpG-DNA-mediated T-helper type-1 response was also abolished in TLR9-/- mice. Thus, vertebrate immune systems appear to have evolved a specific Toll-like receptor that distinguishes bacterial DNA from self-DNA.},

abstract = {Inflammation involves a coordinated, sequential, and self limiting sequence of events controlled by positive and negative regulatory mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs), an evolutionarily conserved class of endogenous 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs, contribute to the regulation of inflammation by repressing gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In this study, we characterize the profile of miRNAs induced by LPS in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes. In particular, we identify miR-9 as the only miRNA (among 365 analyzed) up-regulated in both cell types after TLR4 activation. miR-9 is also induced by TLR2 and TLR7/8 agonists and by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, but not by IFNgamma. Among the 3 different genes encoding miR-9 precursors in humans, we show that LPS selectively induces the transcription of miR-9-1 located in the CROC4 locus, in a MyD88- and NF-kappaB-dependent manner. In PMN and monocytes, LPS regulates NFKB1 at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, and a conserved miR-9 seed sustained a miR-9-dependent inhibition of the NFKB1 transcript. Overall, these data suggest that TLR4-activated NF-kappaB rapidly increases the expression of miR-9 that operates a feedback control of the NF-kappaB-dependent responses by fine tuning the expression of a key member of the NF-kappaB family.},

abstract = {In this study, we reasoned that if we challenged rainbow trout with the causative agents of enteric redmouth disease (ERM), rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS), and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), we would: 1) detect additive genetic variation for resistance to ERM, RTFS, and VHS; and 2) find that resistance of the trout to ERM and RTFS are favourably correlated genetically, while resistance to VHS is unfavourably correlated with resistance to ERM and RTFS. We tested these premises by challenging 63 full-sib families of rainbow trout (50 sires, 38 dams) with Yersinia ruckeri, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and VHS virus, the causative agents of ERM, RTFS, and VHS. Resistance to each disease was assessed as both a binary trait (i.e., died/survived) and a longitudinal trait (i.e., time until death following challenge). Additive genetic variation and genetic correlations for resistance to ERM, RTFS, and VHS were estimated by fitting a threshold liability model to resistance assessed as a binary trait. As a longitudinal trait, additive genetic variation and genetic correlations were estimated by fitting a Weibull frailty model to the times until death. Our findings support the first of our premises as we detected additive genetic variation for resistance to ERM, RTFS, and VHS. The heritability for resistance to ERM, RTFS, and VHS ranged between 0.42 and 0.57 on the underlying liability scale when resistance was assessed as a binary trait. As a longitudinal trait, the heritabilities ranged between 0.07 and 0.21 for time until death on the logarithmic-time scale. We were, however, unable to support our second premise as we found that resistance to each of the diseases tended to be weakly correlated genetically. The genetic correlations between the resistances ranged between -0.11 and 0.15 when resistance was assessed as a binary trait, and between -0.23 and 0.16 when resistance was assessed as a longitudinal trait. These findings are encouraging for commercial trout production. The additive genetic variation detected for resistance demonstrates that selectively breeding trout for resistance to ERM, RTFS, and VHS will be successful, providing a complementary approach to control these diseases. The weak genetic correlations suggest that it should be relatively easy to improve resistance to each of the diseases simultaneously.},

Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Association of parasite load with genotypes was examined using model based and model free approaches. Allele and haplotype based risk assessment for disease severity was performed by stratifying the patients into high and low parasitemic groups on the basis of a threshold value derived by employing a two-component mixture model and expectation-maximization algorithm. The mean parasitemia was significantly increased for variant homozygous genotype (C/C) at TNF-$\alpha$ promoter -1031 and major homozygous genotypes encoding Asp/Asp and Thr/Thr at codons 299 and 399, respectively, on TLR4 polypeptide. Individuals harboring combined genotype C/C-Asp/Asp-Thr/Thr on TNF-$\alpha$ and TLR4 presented the highest parasite load. The frequencies of variant allele C in TNF-1031 (OR = 1.91 with 95{\%} CI = 1.24-2.94) and TNF-$\alpha$ promoter haplotypes C-C-G-G (OR = 1.99 with 95{\%} CI = 1.21-3.27) and C-C-G-A (OR = 2.96 with 95{\%} CI = 1.19-7.37) pertaining to loci TNF-1031/-857/-308/-238 were significantly elevated in the high parasitemic group. On the contrary, the frequencies of variant allele encoding Ile at 399 (OR = 0.55 with 95{\%} CI = 0.32-0.94) and haplotype corresponding to Gly-Ile (299-399) (OR = 0.51 with 95{\%} CI = 0.28-0.9) in TLR4 were higher in low parasitemic group. In silico analysis indicate differential binding of transcription factors to TNF-$\alpha$ promoter haplotypes and alteration in the surface charge distribution of the TLR4 variant proteins. Our results support a genetic role of TLR4 and TNF-$\alpha$ in controlling the blood infection level in mild malaria. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that initiate an innate immune response contain an extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain and an intracellular Toll IL-receptor (TIR) domain. There are fifteen different TLRs in vertebrates. The LRR domains, which adopt a solenoid structure, usually have higher rates of evolution than do the TIR globular domains. It is important to understand the molecular evolution and functional roles of TLRs from this standpoint. Both pairwise genetic distances and Ka/. Ks's (the ratios between non synonymous and synonymous substitution rates) were compared between the LRR domain and the TIR domain of 366 vertebrate TLRs from 96 species (from fish to primates). In fourteen members (TLRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11/12, 13, 14, 21, and 22/23) the LRR domains evolved significantly more rapidly than did the corresponding TIR domains. The evolutionary rates of the LRR domains are significantly different among these members; LRR domains from TLR3 and TLR7 from primates to fishes have the lowest rate of evolution. In contrast, the fifteenth member, TLR10, shows no significant differences; its TIR domain is not highly conserved. The present results suggest that TLR10 may have a different function in signaling from those other members and that a higher conservation of TLR3 and TLR7 may reflect a more ancient mechanism and/or structure in the innate immune response system. Gene conversions are suggested to have occurred in platypus TLR6 and TLR10. This study provides new insight about structural and functional diversification of vertebrate TLRs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Motion-activated cameras (“camera traps”) are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or “out-of-distribution” in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98{\%} accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82{\%} accuracy and correctly identified 94{\%} of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.},

abstract = {Ecologists are concerned with the relationships between species composition and environmental factors, and with spatial structure within those relationships. A dissimilarity-based framework incorporating space explicitly is an extremely flexible tool for answering these questions. The R package ecodist brings together methods for working with dissimilarities, including some not available in other R packages. We present some of the features of ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and make recommendations for their effective use. Although the partial Mantel test is often used to account for the effects of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its effectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a modification of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear structures. This extension of the method allows the use of partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship between variables at different spatial scales. Some of the possibilities are demonstrated using both artificial data and data from an ongoing study of plant community composition in grazinglands of the northeastern United States.},

The codominant Lpsd allele of C3H/HeJ mice was shown to correspond to a missense mutation in the third exon of the Toll-like receptor-4 gene (Tlr4), predicted to replace proline with histidine at position 712 of the polypeptide chain. C57BL/10ScCr mice are homozygous for a null mutation of Tlr4. Thus, the mammalian Tlr4 protein has been adapted primarily to subserve the recognition of LPS and presumably transduces the LPS signal across the plasma membrane. Destructive mutations of Tlr4 predispose to the development of Gram-negative sepsis, leaving most aspects of immune function intact.},

abstract = {Aims to provide general technicians who manage pects in production with a convenient way to recognize them, a novel method to classify insects by analyzing color histogram and GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices) of wing images is proposed. The wing image of lepidopteran insect is preprocessed to get the ROI (Region of Interest); then the color image is first converted from RGB(Red-Green-Blue) to HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) space, and the 1D color histograms of ROI are generated from hue and saturation distributions. Afterward, the color image is converted to grayscale one, rotated and transformed to a standard position, and their GLCM features are extracted. Matching is first undergone by computing the correlation of the histogram vectors between testing and template images; if the correlation is higher than certain threshold, then their GLCM features are further matched. The winner-take-all policy is adopted in deciding most matched species in k nearest neighbors. The method is tested at the lepidopteran insect database with 100 species. The recognition rate is as high as 71.1{\%}. An ideal time performance is also achieved. The experimental results testify the efficiency of proposed method.},

abstract = {Avian-specific toll like receptor 15 (TLR15) is functionally equivalent to a group of TLR2 family proteins that the mammalian innate immune system utilizes to recognize a broad spectrum of microbe-associated molecular patterns, including bacterial lipoproteins. In this study we examined the role of chicken TLR2 family members in the innate immune response to the avian pathogenic bacterium, Mycoplasma synoviae. We found that Mycoplasma synoviae, and specifically the N-terminal diacylated lipopeptide (MDLP) representing the amino-terminal portion of its mature haemagglutinin protein, significantly induces the expression of TLR15, but not TLR1 and TLR2 in chicken macrophages and chondrocytes. TLR15 activation is specific and depends on diacylation of the lipopeptide. Activation of TLR15 after stimulation with Mycoplasma synoviae and MDLP triggers an increase in the expression of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B and nitric oxide production. Moreover, transfection of avian macrophage cells with small interfering RNA reduces the expression of TLR15 after stimulation with MDLP. This leads to decreased activation of the innate immune response, as measured by nitric oxide production. Additionally, pretreatment of cells with neutralizing anti-TLR15 antibody results in a notable attenuation of MDLP-driven release of nitric oxide. This positive correlation may constitute a mechanism for stimulating the innate immune response against avian mycoplasmas in chicken cells via TLR15.},

abstract = {The Toll-Like receptor (TLR) pathway plays a core role in innate immunity and is maintained with remarkable consistency across all vertebrate species. Amidst this background of overall conservation, subtle differences in the components that make up this pathway may have important implications for species-specific defense against key pathogens. Here we employ a homology-based comparative method to characterize the TLR pathway in the recently sequenced chicken and zebra finch genomes, which represent two distantly related bird species. The key features of the TLR pathway are conserved in birds and mammals, although some clear differences exist. The TLR receptors show a pattern of gene duplication and gene loss in both avian species when compared to mammals. In particular, we observe avian specific duplication of both TLR1 and TLR2 as well and a recent duplication of the TLR7 gene in the zebra finch lineage. Both positive selection and gene conversion shape the evolution of the avian specific TLR2 genes. In addition, there are notable differences in the zebra finch repertoire of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) when compared to those of the chicken. Bioinformatic analysis reveals no evidence of cathelicidins in the zebra finch genome but does identify a cluster of 12 novel defensins which map to the avian beta-defensin locus on chromosome 3. These findings contribute to the characterization of the differing immune response systems that have evolved in individual vertebrate species in response to their microbiological environment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the estimation of individual inbreeding coefficients in natural populations has been challenging, and, consequently, the full effect of inbreeding on fitness remains unclear. Genomic inbreeding coefficients may resolve the long-standing paucity of data on inbreeding depression in adult traits and total fitness. Here we investigate inbreeding depression in a range of life history traits and fitness in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Scotland using individual inbreeding coefficients derived from dense Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data ([Formula: see text]). We find associations between[Formula: see text]and annual breeding success in both sexes, and between maternal inbreeding coefficient and offspring survival. We also confirm previous findings of inbreeding depression in birth weight and juvenile survival. In contrast, inbreeding coefficients calculated from a deep and comparatively complete pedigree detected inbreeding depression in juvenile survival, but not in any adult fitness component. The total effect of inbreeding on lifetime breeding success (LBS) was substantial in both sexes: for[Formula: see text][Formula: see text], a value resulting from a half-sib mating, LBS declined by 72{\%} for females and 95{\%} for males. Our results demonstrate that SNP-based estimates of inbreeding provide a powerful tool for evaluating inbreeding depression in natural populations, and suggest that, to date, the prevalence of inbreeding depression in adult traits may have been underestimated.},

abstract = {The Toll family of class I transmembrane receptors recognizes and responds to diverse structures associated with pathogenic microorganisms. These receptors mediate initial responses in innate immunity and are required for the development of the adaptive immune response. Toll receptor signaling pathways are also implicated in serious autoimmune diseases such as endotoxic shock and thus are important therapeutic targets. In this review we discuss how microbial structures as different as nucleic acids and lipoproteins can be recognized by the extracellular domains of Toll receptors. We review recent evidence that the mechanism of signal transduction is complex and involves sequential changes in the conformation of the receptor induced by binding of the ligand. Finally, we assess the emerging area of cross talk in the Toll pathways. Recent work suggests that signaling through TLR4 in response to endotoxin is modified by inputs from at least two other pathways acting through beta2 integrins and protein kinase Cepsilon.},

abstract = {Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever-increasing stream of geospatial data, but current approaches may not be optimal when system behaviour is dominated by spatial or temporal context. Here, rather than amending classical machine learning, we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning (an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically) to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems, improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales, for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning. H umans have always striven to predict and understand the world, and the ability to make better predictions has given competitive advantages in diverse contexts (such as weather, diseases or financial markets). Yet the tools for prediction have substantially changed over time, from ancient Greek philosophical reasoning to non-scientific medieval methods such as soothsaying, towards modern scientific discourse , which has come to include hypothesis testing, theory development and computer modelling underpinned by statistical and physical relationships, that is, laws 1. A success story in the geosciences is weather prediction, which has greatly improved through the integration of better theory, increased computational power, and established observational systems, which allow for the assimilation of large amounts of data into the modelling system 2. Nevertheless, we can accurately predict the evolution of the weather on a timescale of days, not months. Seasonal meteorological predictions, forecasting extreme events such as flooding or fire, and long-term climate projections are still major challenges. This is especially true for predicting dynamics in the biosphere, which is dominated by biologically mediated processes such as growth or reproduction, and is strongly controlled by seemingly stochastic disturbances such as fires and landslides. Such predictive problems have not seen much progress in the past few decades 3. At the same time, a deluge of Earth system data has become available, with storage volumes already well beyond dozens of petabytes and rapidly increasing transmission rates exceeding hundreds of terabytes per day 4. These data come from a plethora of sensors measuring states, fluxes and intensive or time/space-integrated variables, representing fifteen or more orders of temporal and spatial magnitude. They include remote sensing from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres above Earth as well as in situ observations (increasingly from autonomous sensors) at and below the surface and in the atmosphere, many of which are further being complemented by citizen science observations. Model simulation output adds to this deluge; the CMIP-5 dataset of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project, used extensively for scientific groundwork towards periodic climate assessments, is over 3 petabytes in size, and the next generation, CMIP-6, is estimated to reach up to 30 petabytes 5. The data from models share many of the challenges and statistical properties of observational data, including many forms of uncertainty. In summary, Earth system data are exemplary of all four of the 'four Vs' of 'big data': volume, velocity, variety and veracity (see Fig. 1). One key challenge is to extract interpret-able information and knowledge from this big data, possibly almost in real time and integrating between disciplines. Taken together, our ability to collect and create data far outpaces our ability to sensibly assimilate it, let alone understand it. Predictive ability in the last few decades has not increased apace with data availability. To get the most out of the explosive growth and diversity of Earth system data, we face two major tasks in the coming years: (1) extracting knowledge from the data deluge, and (2) deriving models that learn much more from data than traditional data assimilation approaches can, while still respecting our evolving understanding of nature's laws. The combination of unprecedented data sources, increased computational power, and the recent advances in statistical modelling and machine learning offer exciting new opportunities for expanding our knowledge about the Earth system from data. In particular, many tools are available from the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, but they need to be further developed and adapted to geo-scientific analysis. Earth system science offers new opportunities, challenges and methodological demands, in particular for recent research lines focusing on spatio-temporal context and uncertainties (Box 1; see https://developers. google.com/machine-learning/glossary/ and http://www.wildml.com/ deep-learning-glossary/ for more complete glossaries). In the following sections we review the development of machine learning in the geoscientific context, and highlight how deep learning-that is, the automatic extraction of abstract (spatio-temporal) features-has the potential to overcome many of the limitations that have, until now, hindered a more widespread adoption of machine learning. We further lay out the most promising but also challenging approaches in combining machine learning with physical modelling. State-of-the-art geoscientific machine learning Machine learning is now a successful part of several research-driven and operational geoscientific processing schemes, addressing the atmosphere, the land surface and the ocean, and has co-evolved with data availability over the past decade. Early landmarks in classification of land cover and clouds emerged almost 30 years ago through the coincidence of high-resolution satellite data and the first revival of neural networks 6,7.

abstract = {Objectives of this study were to determine the combined market share of breeding companies in aquaculture production in Europe, to describe the main characteristics of breeding companies and their programs, and to provide per species estimates on cumulative genetic gain in growth performance. Surveys were conducted among breeding companies of five major species cultured in Europe: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, European seabass, gilthead seabream, and turbot. The market share was estimated as the combined egg or juvenile production of breeding companies relative to the total egg or juvenile production in Europe for each species in 2012. Cumulative genetic gain was estimated from the number of selected generations in current breeding programs, combined with genetic trends, reported selection responses in literature, and phenotypic differences. The combined market share of breeding companies ranged from 43–56{\%} for seabass to 100{\%} for turbot. The total volume of fish production in Europe that originated from selective breeding was 1653–1706 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 80–83{\%} of the total aquaculture production. Over species, there were 37 breeding programs of which the majority performed family selection. Growth performance was universally selected upon. Cumulative genetic gain in growth performance varied from + 65{\%} for turbot to + 900{\%} for trout in terms of harvest weight, and from + 25{\%} for turbot to + 200{\%} for trout in terms of thermal growth coefficient. It is concluded that selective breeding has a major impact on European aquaculture and will contribute to future growth of the sector. Statement of relevance This manuscript helps to understand the impact of selective breeding on European aquaculture. It shows that the adoption of selective breeding is much higher in Europe than globally. It demonstrates that selective breeding has led to major improvements. Forecasts of industry trends are made and the importance of selective breeding to future growth of aquaculture production is illustrated.},

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the principal proinflammatory component of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope and is recognized by the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-MD-2 receptor complex. Bacteria can alter the acylation state of their LPS in response to environmental changes. One opportunistic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, synthesizes more highly acylated (hexa-acylated) LPS structures during adaptation to the cystic fibrosis airway. Here we show that human, but not murine, TLR4-MD-2 recognizes this adaptation and transmits robust proinflammatory signals in response to hexa-acylated but not penta-acylated LPS from P. aeruginosa. Whereas responses to lipidIVA and taxol are dependent on murine MD-2, discrimination of P. aeruginosa LPS structures is mediated by an 82-amino-acid region of human TLR4 that is hypervariable across species. Thus, in contrast to mice, humans use TLR4 to recognize a molecular signature of bacterial-host adaptation to modulate the innate immune response.},

abstract = {The failure of gene-for-gene resistance traits to provide durable and broad-spectrum resistance in an agricultural context has led to the search for genes underlying quantitative resistance in plants. Such genes have been identified in only a few cases, all for fungal or nematode resistance, and encode diverse molecular functions. However, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of quantitative resistance variation to other enemies and the associated evolutionary forces shaping this variation remain largely unknown. We report the identification, map-based cloning and functional validation of QRX3 (RKS1, Resistance related KinaSe 1), conferring broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas campestris (Xc), a devastating worldwide bacterial vascular pathogen of crucifers. RKS1 encodes an atypical kinase that mediates a quantitative resistance mechanism in plants by restricting bacterial spread from the infection site. Nested Genome-Wide Association mapping revealed a major locus corresponding to an allelic series at RKS1 at the species level. An association between variation in resistance and RKS1 transcription was found using various transgenic lines as well as in natural accessions, suggesting that regulation of RKS1 expression is a major component of quantitative resistance to Xc. The co-existence of long lived RKS1 haplotypes in A. thaliana is shared with a variety of genes involved in pathogen recognition, suggesting common selective pressures. The identification of RKS1 constitutes a starting point for deciphering the mechanisms underlying broad spectrum quantitative disease resistance that is effective against a devastating and vascular crop pathogen. Because putative RKS1 orthologous have been found in other Brassica species, RKS1 provides an exciting opportunity for plant breeders to improve resistance to black rot in crops.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Machine learning methods, a family of statistical techniques with origins in the field of artificial intelligence, are recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and prediction about ecological phenomena. These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machine learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.},

abstract = {The evolution of self-fertilization is associated with a large reduction in the effective rate of recombination and a corresponding decline in effective population size. If many spontaneous mutations are slightly deleterious, this shift in the breeding system is expected to lead to a reduced efficacy of natural selection and genome-wide changes in the rates of molecular evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of the breeding system on molecular evolution in the highly self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing its coding and noncoding genomic regions with those of its close outcrossing relative, the self-incompatible A. lyrata. More distantly related species in the Brassicaceae are used as outgroups to polarize the substitutions along each lineage. In contrast to expectations, no significant difference in the rates of protein evolution is observed between selfing and outcrossing Arabidopsis species. Similarly, no consistent overall difference in codon bias is observed between the species, although for low-biased genes A. lyrata shows significantly higher major codon usage. There is also evidence of intron size evolution in A. thaliana, which has consistently smaller introns than its outcrossing congener, potentially reflecting directional selection on intron size. The results are discussed in the context of heterogeneity in selection coefficients across loci and the effects of life history and population structure on rates of molecular evolution. Using estimates of substitution rates in coding regions and approximate estimates of divergence and generation times, the genomic deleterious mutation rate (U) for amino acid substitutions in Arabidopsis is estimated to be approximately 0.2-0.6 per generation.},

abstract = {Understanding the relative role of different evolutionary forces in shaping the level and distribution of functional genetic diversity among natural populations is a key issue in evolutionary and conservation biology. To do so accurately genetic data must be analysed in conjunction with an unambiguous understanding of the historical processes that have acted upon the populations. Here, we focused on diversity at toll-like receptor (TLR) loci, which play a key role in the vertebrate innate immune system and, therefore, are expected to be under pathogen-mediated selection. We assessed TLR variation within and among 13 island populations (grouped into three archipelagos) of Berthelot's pipit, Anthus berthelotii, for which detailed population history has previously been ascertained. We also compared the variation observed with that found in its widespread sister species, the tawny pipit, Anthus campestris. We found strong evidence for positive selection at specific codons in TLR1LA, TLR3 and TLR4. Despite this, we found that at the allele frequency level, demographic history has played the major role in shaping patterns of TLR variation in Berthelot's pipit. Levels of diversity and differentiation within and across archipelagos at all TLR loci corresponded very closely with neutral microsatellite variation and with the severity of the bottlenecks that occurred during colonization. Our study shows that despite the importance of TLRs in combating pathogens, demography can be the main driver of immune gene variation within and across populations, resulting in patterns of functional variation that can persist over evolutionary timescales.},

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Widespread concerns about global biodiversity loss have led to a growing demand for indices of biodiversity status. Today, climate change is among the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Although many studies have revealed phenological responses to climate change, no long-term community-level indices have been developed. We derived a 250-year index of first flowering dates for 405 plant species in the UK for assessing the impact of climate change on plant communities. The estimated community-level index in the most recent 25 years was 2.2-12.7 days earlier than any other consecutive 25-year period since 1760. The index was closely correlated with February-April mean Central England Temperature, with flowering 5.0 days earlier for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. The index was relatively sensitive to the number of species, not records per species, included in the model. Our results demonstrate how multi-species, multiple-site phenological events can be integrated to obtain indices showing trends for each species and across species. This index should play an important role in monitoring the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to incorporate data from other taxa and countries for evaluating cross-taxa and cross-country phenological responses to climate change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity are expected to increase the extinction risk of small populations, but detailed tests in natural populations are scarce. We combine long-term population and fitness data with those from two types of molecular markers to examine the role of genetic effects in a declining metapopulation of southern dunlins Calidris alpina schinzii, an endangered shorebird. RESULTS: The decline is associated with increased pairings between related individuals, including close inbreeding (as revealed by both field observations of parentage and molecular markers). Furthermore, reduced genetic diversity seems to affect individual fitness at several life stages. Higher genetic similarity between mates correlates negatively with the pair's hatching success. Moreover, offspring produced by related parents are more homozygous and suffer from increased mortality during embryonic development and possibly also after hatching. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate strong genetic effects in a rapidly declining population, emphasizing the importance of genetic factors for the persistence of small populations.},

abstract = {It is now widely accepted that novel infectious disease can be a leading cause of serious population decline and even outright extinction in some invertebrate and vertebrate groups (e.g., amphibians). In the case of mammals, however, there are still no well-corroborated instances of such diseases having caused or significantly contributed to the complete collapse of species. A case in point is the extinction of the endemic Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari): although it has been argued that its disappearance ca. AD 1900 may have been partly or wholly caused by a pathogenic trypanosome carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), no decisive evidence for this scenario has ever been adduced. Using ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888-1908), we were able to resolve unambiguously sequence evidence of murid trypanosomes in both endemic and invasive rats. Importantly, endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of black rats were devoid of trypanosome signal. Hybridization between endemic and black rats was also previously hypothesized, but we found no evidence of this in examined specimens, and conclude that hybridization cannot account for the disappearance of the endemic species. This is the first molecular evidence for a pathogen emerging in a na{\"{i}}ve mammal species immediately prior to its final collapse.},

abstract = {Letting a deep network be aware of the quality of its own predictions is an interesting yet important problem. In the task of instance segmentation, the confidence of instance classification is used as mask quality score in most instance segmentation frameworks. However, the mask quality, quantified as the IoU between the instance mask and its ground truth, is usually not well correlated with classification score. In this paper, we study this problem and propose Mask Scoring R-CNN which contains a network block to learn the quality of the predicted instance masks. The proposed network block takes the instance feature and the corresponding predicted mask together to regress the mask IoU. The mask scoring strategy calibrates the misalignment between mask quality and mask score, and improves instance segmentation performance by prioritizing more accurate mask predictions during COCO AP evaluation. By extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset, Mask Scoring R-CNN brings consistent and noticeable gain with different models, and outperforms the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN. We hope our simple and effective approach will provide a new direction for improving instance segmentation.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the importance of pedigree depth when performing optimal contribution selection as implemented in the software program EVA. This was done by applying optimal genetic contribution in the breeding program of the major Danish Dairy breed Danish Holstein. In the analyses earlier breeding decisions were considered by including all AI waiting- and young bulls and contract matings. Twenty potential sires, 2169 potential dams, 1421 AI-bulls and 754 contract matings plus pedigree animals were included. Results showed that the outcome was very dependent on quality of pedigree, also for information going more than 25 years (5-7 generations) back. The analyses showed that EVA works satisfactorily as a management tool for planning of breeding schemes with respect to contributions of sires of sons at population level in maximising the genetic gain, while controlling the increase in future inbreeding. The more weight put on the average additive genetic relationship in next generation relative to genetic merit, the lower the average merit of the matings, and the lower average additive genetic relationship among the chosen matings and the present breeding animals. Furthermore more weight on average additive genetic relationship gives a more diverse use of sires of sons. Given the potential sires and dams the average additive genetic relationship among the selected matings and the present breeding animals can be reduced from 0.1621 to 0.1495 at the cost of 0.7 genetic S.D. units at the total merit index. This reduction was obtained when selection was only on reduction of average relationship compared to selection only on genetic merit. Optimal genetic contribution selection is a promising tool for managing breeding schemes for populations facing inbreeding problems, such as Danish Holstein and other dairy breeds. However sufficient pedigree information is a necessity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fillet yield (FY, {\%}) is an economically-important trait in rainbow trout aquaculture that affects production efficiency. Despite that, FY has received little attention in breeding programs because it is difficult to measure on a large number of fish and cannot be directly measured on breeding candidates. The recent development of a high-density SNP array for rainbow trout has provided the needed tool for studying the underlying genetic architecture of this trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for FY, body weight at 10 (BW10) and 13 (BW13) months post-hatching, head-off carcass weight (CAR), and fillet weight (FW) in a pedigreed rainbow trout population selectively bred for improved growth performance. The GWAS analysis was performed using the weighted single-step GBLUP method (wssGWAS). Phenotypic records of 1447 fish (1.5 kg at harvest) from 299 full-sib families in three successive generations, of which 875 fish from 196 full-sib families were genotyped, were used in the GWAS analysis. A total of 38,107 polymorphic SNPs were analyzed in a univariate model with hatch year and harvest group as fixed effects, harvest weight as a continuous covariate, and animal and common environment as random effects. A new linkage map was developed to create windows of 20 adjacent SNPs for use in the GWAS. The two windows with largest effect for FY and FW were located on chromosome Omy9 and explained only 1.0-1.5{\%} of genetic variance, thus suggesting a polygenic architecture affected by multiple loci with small effects in this population. One window on Omy5 explained 1.4 and 1.0{\%} of the genetic variance for BW10 and BW13, respectively. Three windows located on Omy27, Omy17, and Omy9 (same window detected for FY) explained 1.7, 1.7, and 1.0{\%}, respectively, of genetic variance for CAR. Among the detected 100 SNPs, 55{\%} were located directly in genes (intron and exons). Nucleotide sequences of intragenic SNPs were blasted to the Mus musculus genome to create a putative gene network. The network suggests that differences in the ability to maintain a proliferative and renewable population of myogenic precursor cells may affect variation in growth and fillet yield in rainbow trout.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the evolution of genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is rapidly increasing, but there are still enigmatic questions remaining, particularly regarding the maintenance of high levels of MHC polymorphisms in small, isolated populations. Here, we analyze the genetic variation at eight microsatellite loci and sequence variation at exon 2 of the MHC class IIB (DAB) genes in two wild populations of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We compare the genetic variation of a small ({\$}N{\_}e \backslashapprox 100{\$}) and relatively isolated upland population to that of its much larger ({\$}N{\_}e \backslashapprox 2400{\$}) downstream counterpart. As predicted, microsatellite diversity in the upland population is significantly lower and highly differentiated from the population further downstream. Surprisingly, however, these guppy populations are not differentiated by MHC genetic variation and show very similar levels of allelic richness. Computer simulations indicate that the observed level of genetic variation can be maintained with overdominant selection acting at three DAB loci. The selection coefficients differ dramatically between the upland ({\$}s \backslashgeq 0.2{\$}) and lowland ({\$}s \backslashleq 0.01{\$}) populations. Parasitological analysis on wild-caught fish shows that parasite load is significantly higher on upland than on lowland fish, which suggests that large differences in selection intensity may indeed exist between populations. Based on the infection intensity, a substantial proportion of the upland fish would have suffered direct or indirect fitness consequences as a result of their high parasite loads. Selection by parasites plays a particularly important role in the evolution of guppies in the upland habitat, which has resulted in high levels of MHC diversity being maintained in this population despite considerable genetic drift.},

To understand the evolutionary impacts of disease, research has focussed on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a genetic region involved in antigen presentation. There is a pressing need for the broader research currently conducted on traditional vertebrate models to be transferred to wildlife. Incorporating such knowledge will enable a broader understanding of the levels at which natural selection can act on immunity. We propose two new approaches to wildlife immunogenetics and discuss the challenges of conducting such studies. At a time when novel pathogens are increasingly emerging in natural populations, these new approaches are integral to understanding disease dynamics and assessing epidemic risks. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

With the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines. In this review, we provide both the exoteric introduction of deep learning, and concrete examples and implementations of its representative applications in bioinformatics. We start from the recent achievements of deep learning in the bioinformatics field, pointing out the problems which are suitable to use deep learning. After that, we introduce deep learning in an easy-to-understand fashion, from shallow neural networks to legendary convolutional neural networks, legendary recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoder, and the most recent state-of-the-art architectures. After that, we provide eight examples, covering five bioinformatics research directions and all the four kinds of data type, with the implementation written in Tensorflow and Keras. Finally, we discuss the common issues, such as overfitting and interpretability, that users will encounter when adopting deep learning methods and provide corresponding suggestions.

abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) forms an integral component of the vertebrate immune response and, due to strong selection pressures, is one of the most polymorphic regions of the entire genome. Despite over 15 years of research, empirical studies offer highly contradictory explanations of the relative roles of different evolutionary forces, selection and genetic drift, acting on MHC genes during population bottlenecks. Here, we take a meta-analytical approach to quantify the results of studies into the effects of bottlenecks on MHC polymorphism. We show that the consequences of selection acting on MHC loci prior to a bottleneck event, combined with drift during the bottleneck, will result in overall loss of MHC polymorphism that is approximately 15{\%} greater than loss of neutral genetic diversity. These results are counter to general expectations that selection should maintain MHC polymorphism, but do agree with the results of recent simulation models and at least two empirical studies. Notably, our results suggest that negative frequency-dependent selection could be more important than overdominance for maintaining high MHC polymorphism in pre-bottlenecked populations.},

abstract = {The Chatham Island black robin, Petroica traversi, is a highly inbred, endangered passerine with extremely low levels of variation at hypervariable neutral DNA markers. In this study we investigated variation in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes in both the black robin and its nonendangered relative, the South Island robin Petroica australis australis. Previous studies have shown that Petroica have at least four expressed class II B MHC genes. In this study, the sequences of introns flanking exon 2 of these loci were characterized to design primers for peptide-binding region (PBR) sequence analysis. Intron sequences were comprised of varying numbers of repeated units, with highly conserved regions immediately flanking exon 2. Polymerase chain reaction primers designed to this region amplified three or four sequences per black robin individual, and eight to 14 sequences per South Island robin individual. MHC genes are fitness-related genes thought to be under balancing selection, so they may be more likely to retain variation in bottlenecked populations. To test this, we compared MHC variation in the black robin with artificially bottlenecked populations of South Island robin, and with their respective source populations, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses and DNA sequencing of the PBR. Our results indicate that the black robin is monomorphic at class II B MHC loci, while both source and bottlenecked populations of South Island robin have retained moderate levels of variation. Comparison of MHC variation with minisatellite DNA variation indicates that genetic drift outweighs balancing selection in determining MHC diversity in the bottlenecked populations. However, balancing selection appears to influence MHC diversity over evolutionary timescales, and the effects of gene conversion are evident.},

abstract = {In traditional family-based aquaculture breeding, each sire is mated to two dams in order to separate the sire's genetic effect from other family effects. Factorial mating involves more mates per sire and/or dam and result in more but smaller full- and/or half-sib families. For traits measured on sibs of selection candidates, factorial mating increases intensity of selection between families when selection is on traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimated breeding values (TRAD-EBV). However, selection on genome-wide estimated breeding values (GW-EBV), uses both within- and between-family effects and the advantage of factorial mating is less obvious. Our aim was to compare by computer simulation the impact of various factorial mating strategies for truncation selection on TRAD-EBV versus GW-EBV on rates of inbreeding, accuracy of selection and genetic gain for two traits, i.e. one measured on selection candidates (CAND-TRAIT) and one on their sibs (SIB-TRAIT). Sire:dam mating ratios of 1:1, 2:2 or 10:10 were tested with 100, 200 or 1000 families produced from a constant number of parents (100 sires and 100 dams), and a mating ratio of 1:2 with 200 families produced from 100 sires and 200 dams. With GW-EBV, changing the mating ratio from 1:1 to 10:10 had a limited effect on genetic gain (less than 5 {\%}) for both CAND-TRAIT and SIB-TRAIT, whereas with TRAD-EBV, selection intensity increased for SIB-TRAIT and genetic gain increased by 41 and 77 {\%} for schemes with 3000 and 12,000 selection candidates, respectively. For both GW-EBV and TRAD-EBV, rates of inbreeding decreased by up to {\~{}}30 {\%} when the mating ratio was changed from 1:1 to 10:10 for schemes with 3000 to 12,000 selection candidates. Similar results were found for alternative heritabilities of SIB-TRAIT and total number of tested sibs. Changing the sire:dam mating ratio from 1:1 to 10:10 increased genetic gain substantially with TRAD-EBV, mainly through increased selection intensity for the SIB-TRAIT, whereas with GW-EBV, it had a limited effect on genetic gain for both traits. Rates of inbreeding decreased for both selection methods.},

Despite the widespread perception that parasites (in the broad sense, including microbial pathogens) threaten species with extinction, the simplest deterministic models of parasite dynamics (i.e. of specialist parasites with density-dependent transmission) predict that parasites will always go extinct before their hosts. We review the primary theoretical mechanisms that allow disease-induced extinction and compare them with the empirical literature on parasitic threats to populations to assess the importance of different mechanisms in threatening natural populations. Small pre-epidemic population size and the presence of reservoirs are the most commonly cited factors for disease-induced extinction in empirical studies},

abstract = {Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection--an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (http://www.datamonkey.org/).},

abstract = {Describing spatial patterns of phenotypic traits can be important for evolutionary and ecological studies. However, traditional approaches, such as fieldwork, can be time-consuming and expensive. Information technologies, such as Internet search engines, could facilitate the collection of these data. Google Images is one such technology that might offer an opportunity to rapidly collect information on spatial patterns of phenotypic traits. We investigated the use of Google Images in extracting data on geographical variation in phenotypic traits visible from photographs. We compared the distribution of visual traits obtained from Google Images with four previous studies: colour morphs of black bear (Ursus americanus); colouration and spottiness in barn owl (Tyto alba); colour morphs of black sparrowhawk (Accipiter melanoleucus) and the distribution of hooded (Corvus corone) and carrion crows (Corvus cornix) across their European hybrid zone. Additionally, we develop and present a web application (Morphic), which facilitates the human data capture process of this method. We found good agreement between fieldwork data and Google Images data across all studies. Indeed, there was strong agreement between the data obtained from the original study and from the Google Images method for the colour morphs of black bear (R2 = 80{\%}) and for two barn owl plumage traits (R2 = 64{\%} and 53{\%}). Our approach also successfully matched the clinal variation of black sparrowhawks morphs across South Africa. Our method also gave a good agreement between the distribution of hooded and carrion crows (with 86{\%} placed on the correct side of the hybrid zone line). Our results suggest that this method can work well for visible traits of common and widespread species that are objective, binary, and easy to see irrespective of angle. The Google Images method is cost-effective and rapid and can be used with some confidence when investigating patterns of geographical variation, as well as a range of other applications. In many cases, it could therefore supplement or replace fieldwork.},

abstract = {Individual-based estimates of the degree of inbreeding or parental relatedness from pedigrees provide a critical starting point for studies of inbreeding depression, but in practice wild pedigrees are difficult to obtain. Because inbreeding increases the proportion of genomewide loci that are identical by descent, inbreeding variation within populations has the potential to generate observable correlations between heterozygosity measured using molecular markers and a variety of fitness related traits. Termed heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs), these correlations have been observed in a wide variety of taxa. The difficulty of obtaining wild pedigree data, however, means that empirical investigations of how pedigree inbreeding influences HFCs are rare. Here, we assess evidence for inbreeding depression in three life-history traits (hatching and fledging success and juvenile survival) in an isolated population of Stewart Island robins using both pedigree- and molecular-derived measures of relatedness. We found results from the two measures were highly correlated and supported evidence for significant but weak inbreeding depression. However, standardized effect sizes for inbreeding depression based on the pedigree-based kin coefficients (k) were greater and had smaller standard errors than those based on molecular genetic measures of relatedness (RI), particularly for hatching and fledging success. Nevertheless, the results presented here support the use of molecular-based measures of relatedness in bottlenecked populations when information regarding inbreeding depression is desired but pedigree data on relatedness are unavailable.},

abstract = {During population establishment, genetic drift can be the key driver of changes in genetic diversity, particularly while the population is small. However, natural selection can also play a role in shaping diversity at functionally important loci. We used a well-studied, re-introduced population of the threatened Stewart Island robin (N = 722 pedigreed individuals) to determine whether selection shaped genetic diversity at innate immunity toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, over a 9-year period of population growth following establishment with 12 genetic founders. We found no evidence for selection operating with respect to TLR diversity on first-year overwinter survival for the majority of loci, genotypes and alleles studied. However, survival of individuals with TLR4BE genotype was significantly improved: these birds were less than half as likely to die prior to maturity compared with all other TLR4 genotypes. Furthermore, the population frequency of this genotype, at a two-fold excess over Hardy-Weinberg expectation, was increased by nonrandom mating. Near-complete sampling and full pedigree and reproductive data enabled us to eliminate other potential causes of these patterns including inbreeding, year effects, density dependence, selection on animals at earlier life history stages or genome-level association of the TLR4E allele with 'good genes'. However, comparison of observed levels of gene diversity to predictions under simulated genetic drift revealed results consistent with neutral expectations for all loci, including TLR4. Although selection favoured TLR4BE heterozygotes in this population, these effects were insufficient to outweigh genetic drift. This is the first empirical study to show that genetic drift can overwhelm natural selection in a wild population immediately following establishment.},

These receptors evolved to recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not by the host. Recognition of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish infectious nonself from noninfectious self. Toll-like receptors play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Stimulation of Toll-like receptors by microbial products leads to the activation of signaling pathways that result in the induction of antimicrobial genes and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, stimulation of Toll-like receptors triggers dendritic cell maturation and results in the induction of costimulatory molecules and increased antigen-presenting capacity. Thus, microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors helps to direct adaptive immune responses to antigens derived from microbial pathogens.},

Most monitoring programs, however, do not take full advantage of the potential afforded by molecular genetic markers, which can provide information relevant to both ecological and evolutionary time frames, while costing less and being more sensitive and reliable than traditional monitoring approaches. As several molecular and computational approaches are relatively new, many technical and theoretical issues remain to be resolved. Here, we illustrate how DNA and population genetic data can provide valuable information, often unattainable via other approaches, for monitoring species of management, conservation and ecological interest. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the influence of ovarian fluid (OV) on the gamete physiology in the brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario). In comparison to water OV prolongs the duration of sperm motility for {\textgreater}5min andthe fertilizability of eggs for {\textgreater}10 min independent from the quality of the egg batch from which the OV derived. These stabilizing effects are related to the inorganic composition of OV as similar results are obtained in buffered artificial saline solution (AFS). OV compensates also for sub-optimal environmental conditions as demonstrated in fertilization experiments with mixtures of OV and buffer solutions of different pH. At a dilution ratio of OV : water of 1:1 the stabilizing effect on gametes is significantly decreased and at a dilution ratio of 1:8 it is completely lost. Due to the described effects significantly higher fertilization rates are obtained in OV than in water. In OV the fertilization rates are also higher than in AFS but only at low sperm to egg ratios or when semen with low motility rates and swimming velocities is used. This is considered to be due to a semen dependent egg activation which is partly suppressed by a OV protein with a molecular weight between 20 and 62 kdaltons. The phenomen is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main inducer of shock and death in Gram-negative sepsis. Recent evidence suggests that LPS-induced signal transduction begins with CD14-mediated activation of 1 or more Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The lipid A analogues lipid IVa and Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A (RSLA) exhibit an uncommon species-specific pharmacology. Both compounds inhibit the effects of LPS in human cells but display LPS-mimetic activity in hamster cells. We transfected human TLR4 or human TLR2 into hamster fibroblasts to determine if either of these LPS signal transducers is responsible for the species-specific pharmacology. RSLA and lipid IVa strongly induced NF-kappaB activity and IL-6 release in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts expressing CD14 (CHO/CD14), but these compounds antagonized LPS antagonists in CHO/CD14 fibroblasts that overexpressed human TLR4. No such antagonism occurred in cells overexpressing human TLR2. We cloned TLR4 from hamster macrophages and found that human THP-1 cells expressing the hamster TLR4 responded to lipid IVa as an LPS mimetic, as if they were hamster in origin. Hence, cells heterologously overexpressing TLR4 from different species acquired a pharmacological phenotype with respect to recognition of lipid A substructures that corresponded to the species from which the TLR4 transgene originated. These data suggest that TLR4 is the central lipid A-recognition protein in the LPS receptor complex.},

abstract = {There is controversy concerning the role of genetic factors in species extinctions. Many authors have asserted that species are usually driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact them, but few studies have seriously addressed this issue. If this assertion is true, there will be little difference in genetic diversity between threatened and taxonomically related nonthreatened species. We compared average heterozygosities in 170 threatened taxa with those in taxonomically related nonthreatened taxa in a comprehensive metaanalysis. Heterozygosity was lower in threatened taxa in 77{\%} of comparisons, a highly significant departure from the predictions of the no genetic impact hypothesis. Heterozygosity was on average 35{\%} lower (median 40{\%}) in threatened taxa than in related nonthreatened ones. These differences in heterozygosity indicate lowered evolutionary potential, compromised reproductive fitness, and elevated extinction risk in the wild. Independent evidence from stochastic computer projections has demonstrated that inbreeding depression elevates extinction risk for threatened species in natural habitats when all other threatening processes are included in the models. Thus, most taxa are not driven to extinction before genetic factors affect them adversely.},

abstract = {Arthropods perform critically important functions in food webs and ecosystems and are highly sensitive to the effects of environmental change. Despite their importance, the knowledge gaps in arthropod ecology are substantial. This is particularly problematic in Earth's polar and alpine regions, where tundra ecosystems are responding rapidly to climate change. Species diversity is lower in these regions versus temperate and tropical regions, but (1) we lack baseline and long-term data about the distributions and abundances of arthropods and their relationships to abiotic variation and (2) the roles of arthropods in these ecosystems are far from fully described. In recognition of the need for increased tundra arthropod research activity, a group of international scientists formed the Network for Arthropods of the Tundra (NeAT). In the past 3 years, this aca-demic network has brought together entomologists from research institutions around the world to revitalize and coordinate the study of tundra arthropods. This special issue on the ecology of tundra arthropods represents a tangible example of this increased momentum. The papers in the special issue highlight recent advances in understanding the relationships between arthropod communities and abiotic variation in tundra ecosystems and clarify the roles that arthropods play in ecosystems. They collectively demonstrate the utility of tundra arthropods as a model system for testing general ecological theory about how species respond to environmental variation. We hope this special issue with the insights it provides and the new fron-tiers it outlines, together with NeAT, will leverage further momentum to the interest in, and study of the ecology of tundra arthropods in the years to come.},

abstract = {Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) causes significant economic losses in salmonid aquaculture, and traditional family-based breeding programs aimed at improving BCWD resistance have been limited to exploiting only between-family variation. We used genomic selection (GS) models to predict genomic breeding values (GEBVs) for BCWD resistance in 10 families from the first generation of the NCCCWA BCWD resistance breeding line, compared the predictive ability (PA) of GEBVs to pedigree-based estimated breeding values (EBVs), and compared the impact of two SNP genotyping methods on the accuracy of GEBV predictions. The BCWD phenotypes survival days (DAYS) and survival status (STATUS) had been recorded in training fish (n = 583) subjected to experimental BCWD challenge. Training fish, and their full sibs without phenotypic data that were used as parents of the subsequent generation, were genotyped using two methods: restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and the Rainbow Trout Axiom {\textregistered} 57 K SNP array (Chip). Animal-specific GEBVs were estimated using four GS models: BayesB, BayesC, single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP), and weighted ssGBLUP (wssGBLUP). Family-specific EBVs were estimated using pedigree and phenotype data in the training fish only. The PA of EBVs and GEBVs was assessed by correlating mean progeny phenotype (MPP) with mid-parent EBV (family-specific) or GEBV (animal-specific). The best GEBV predictions were similar to EBV with PA values of 0.49 and 0.46 vs. 0.50 and 0.41 for DAYS and STATUS, respectively. Among the GEBV prediction methods, ssGBLUP consistently had the highest PA. The RAD genotyping platform had GEBVs with similar PA to those of GEBVs from the Chip platform. The PA of ssGBLUP and wssGBLUP methods was higher with the Chip, but for BayesB and BayesC methods it was higher with the RAD platform. The overall GEBV accuracy in this study was low to moderate, likely due to the small training sample used. This study Vallejo et al. Genomic Selection for BCWD Resistance explored the potential of GS for improving resistance to BCWD in rainbow trout using, for the first time, progeny testing data to assess the accuracy of GEBVs, and it provides the basis for further investigation on the implementation of GS in commercial rainbow trout populations.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs with a small magnitude of perturbation aiming to induce arbitrarily incorrect predictions. Recent studies show that adversarial examples can pose a threat to real-world security-critical applications: a "physically adversarial Stop Sign" can be synthesized such that the autonomous driving cars will misrecognize it as others (e.g., a speed limit sign). However, these image-based adversarial examples cannot easily alter 3D scans such as widely equipped LiDAR or radar on autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we reveal the potential vulnerabilities of LiDAR-based autonomous driving detection systems, by proposing an optimization based approach LiDAR-Adv to generate real-world adversarial objects that can evade the LiDAR-based detection systems under various conditions. We first explore the vulnerabilities of LiDAR using an evolution-based blackbox attack algorithm, and then propose a strong attack strategy, using our gradient-based approach LiDAR-Adv. We test the generated adversarial objects on the Baidu Apollo autonomous driving platform and show that such physical systems are indeed vulnerable to the proposed attacks. We 3D-print our adversarial objects and perform physical experiments with LiDAR equipped cars to illustrate the effectiveness of LiDAR-Adv.

abstract = {Conservation managers typically need to make prompt decisions based on limited information and resources. Consequently, generalisations have essential roles in guiding interventions. Here, we (i) critique information on some widely accepted generalisations and variables affecting them, (ii) assess how adequately genetic factors are currently incorporated into population viability analysis (PVA) models used to estimate minimum viable population sizes, and (iii) relate the above to population size thresholds of the IUCN Red List criteria for threatened species that were derived from genetic considerations. Evidence accumulated since 1980 shows that genetically effective population size (Ne). = 50 is inadequate for preventing inbreeding depression over five generations in the wild, with Ne≥. 100 being required to limit loss in total fitness to ≤10{\%}. Further, even Ne= 500 is too low for retaining evolutionary potential for fitness in perpetuity; a better approximation is Ne≥. 1000. Extrapolation from census population size (N) to Ne depends on knowing the ratio of Ne/. N, yet this information is unavailable for most wild populations. Ratio averages ({\~{}}0.1-0.2) from meta-analyses are sufficient, provided adjustments are made for dissimilar life histories. Most PVA-based risk assessments ignore or inadequately model genetic factors. PVA should routinely include realistic inbreeding depression, and genetic impacts on evolutionary potential should be incorporated where appropriate. Genetic generalisations used in conservation, the treatment of genetics in PVAs, and sections of the IUCN Red List criteria derived from genetic considerations, all require revision to be more effective conservation tools. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Buffering capacities were significantly less at pH values at and above 7.3 than over the range 6.0 to 7.0 and were particularly low between pH values of approximately 7.5 to 8.5. The potential of chinook salmon sperm to become motile upon addition to water was highly sensitive to pH. Only very low levels of motility were demonstrable when sperm had been maintained at pH values at or below 7.5 prior to water exposure while maximum motility was noted when sperm had been maintained at pH values of about 8.0 and above. Thus, the potential for motility appeared especially sensitive to that pH range over which seminal plasma exhibited its lowest buffering capacity. Buffering capacity, protein content and inorganic phosphate content of chinook salmon and steelhead seminal plasmas were less than those of corresponding blood plasma or ovarian fluid suggesting that seminal plasma is unique among salmonid body fluids in its composition and low buffering capacity. This low buffering capacity is likely to facilitate the role of the sperm duct epithelium in semen pH regulation and thus, in the sperm's acquisition of the potential for motility upon exposure to water.},

The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

Computer vision is closely related to the field of image processing. In computer vision the focus is on extracting information from image data, whereas in image processing the focus is on transforming images.

abstract = {As a fitness trait, survival is assumed to exhibit low heritability due to strong selection eroding genetic variation and/or spatio-temporal variation in mortality agents reducing genetic and increasing residual variation. The latter phenomenon in particular may contribute to low heritability in multigeneration data, even if certain cohorts exhibit significant genetic variation. Analysis of survival data from 10 year classes of rainbow trout reared at three test stations showed that treating survival as a single trait across all generations resulted in low heritability (h2 = 0.08-0.17). However, when heritabilities were estimated from homogeneous generation and test station-specific cohorts, a wide range of heritability values was revealed (h2 = 0.04-0.71). Of 64 genetic correlations between different cohorts, 20 were positive, but 16 were significantly negative, confirming that genetic architecture of survival is not stable across generations and environments. These results reveal the existence of hidden genetic variation for survival and demonstrate that treating survival as one trait over several generations may not reveal its true genetic architecture. Negative genetic correlations between cohorts indicate that overall survival has limited potential to predict general resistance, and care should be taken when using it as selection criterion.},

The innate immune system of the host is responsible for providing constant surveillance against infection; when confronted by pathogens it deploys a series of rapidly acting antimicrobial effectors while simultaneously instructing the adaptive immune system as to the nature and context of the infectious threat. Pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity is mediated by members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family through detection of conserved microbial structures that are absent from the host. Experimental models of infection using TLR-deficient mice, as well as limited human studies, have clearly demonstrated the critical role of TLRs in host defense against most major groups of mammalian pathogens.},

Here we provide a guide to recently developed methods for population genetic analysis, including identi- fication of population structure, quantification of gene flow, and inference of demographic history. We cover both allele-frequency and sequence-based approaches, with a special focus on methods relevant to conservation genetic applications. Although classical population genetic approaches such as FST (and its derivatives) have carried the field thus far, newer, more powerful, methods can infer much more from the data, rely on fewer assumptions, and are appropriate for conservation genetic management when precise estimates are needed.

However, as with other genotyping methods, RADseq is prone to a number of sources of error that may have consequential effects for population genetic inferences, and these have received only limited attention in terms of the estimation and reporting of genotyping error rates. Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

abstract = {Discerning the relative roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species, as well as how these processes interact, is a fundamental aim in biology. Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations (isolation by distance), of colonization history and founder effects (isolation by colonization) or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations (isolation by adaptation). Here, we attempt to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos. Using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation, we reveal that the northward colonization of this species ca. 8500 years ago resulted in genetic bottlenecks in the colonized archipelagos. We then show that high levels of genetic structure exist across archipelagos and that these are consistent with a pattern of isolation by colonization, but not with isolation by distance or adaptation. Finally, we show that substantial morphological divergence also exists and that this is strongly concordant with patterns of genetic structure and bottleneck history, but not with environmental differences or geographic distance. Overall, our data suggest that founder effects are responsible for both genetic and phenotypic changes across archipelagos. Our findings provide a rare example of how founder effects can persist over evolutionary timescales and suggest that they may play an important role in the early stages of speciation.},

abstract = {Manually annotating object bounding boxes is central to building computer vision datasets, and it is very time consuming (annotating ILSVRC [53] took 35s for one high-quality box [62]). It involves clicking on imaginary corners of a tight box around the object. This is difficult as these corners are often outside the actual object and several adjustments are required to obtain a tight box. We propose extreme clicking instead: we ask the annotator to click on four physical points on the object: the top, bottom, left- and right-most points. This task is more natural and these points are easy to find. We crowd-source extreme point annotations for PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and show that (1) annotation time is only 7s per box, 5x faster than the traditional way of drawing boxes [62]; (2) the quality of the boxes is as good as the original ground-truth drawn the traditional way; (3) detectors trained on our annotations are as accurate as those trained on the original ground-truth. Moreover, our extreme clicking strategy not only yields box coordinates, but also four accurate boundary points. We show (4) how to incorporate them into GrabCut to obtain more accurate segmentations than those delivered when initializing it from bounding boxes; (5) semantic segmentations models trained on these segmentations outperform those trained on segmentations derived from bounding boxes.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

abstract = {Regional declines in insect pollinators have raised concerns about crop pollination. Many pollinator studies use visitation rate (pollinators/time) as a proxy for the quality of crop pollination. Visitation rate estimates are based on observation durations that vary significantly between studies. How observation duration relates to the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate is, however, unknown. We studied this relationship using six day-long observations (06:00 h–19:00 h) in leek-seed production fields (totalling 78 h). We analysed beyond which point in time observing longer did not significantly improve the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate (minimum observation duration). We furthermore explored the relationship between the minimum observation duration and visitation rate, time of day and temperature. We found that the minimum observation duration (mean ± SD: 24 ± 11.9 min) was significantly related to visitation rate, where the observation time required to obtain accurate estimates decreased with increasing visitation rate. Minimum observation duration varied greatly between days and between fields but not within days. Within days, the visitation rates differed significantly only between the hour-intervals 06:00 h–07:00 h (lowest visitation rate) and 09:00 h–11:00 h (highest rate). Minimum observation duration decreased up to around 22 °C beyond which it remained fairly stable. Surprisingly, even after three day-long observations on the same plant we found new pollinator species visiting the flowers, suggesting that species-richness estimates based on plant observations alone probably underestimate true species richness. Because especially between-day variation in visitation rate on single plants can be large, reliable estimates of the pollinator visitation rate during the plant's flowering time require observations on multiple days. Standardising the number of pollinators rather than the time to observe (standardised pollinator timing approach: time to n-pollinator visits) may provide more consistent accurate assessments of visitation rate, especially for studies that use gradients in visitation rates to examine the contribution of pollinators to crop pollination.},

abstract = {Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to next-generation sequencing approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been developed as a tool for association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. GBS uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a GBS approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme GBS protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified SNPs and tags. We were able to map over 34,000 SNPs and 240,000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20,000 SNPs and 367,000 tags on the Synthetic W9784 × Opata85 (SynOpDH) wheat reference map. To further evaluate GBS in wheat, we also constructed a de novo genetic map using only SNP markers from the GBS data. The GBS approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of GBS data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, GBS will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs.},

abstract = {Low pH of ovarian fluid is attributed to its inability to activate sperm motility. In the present study we sought if broken eggs are reason for the decrease of ovarian fluid pH. We examined if 1) there is relationship between turbidity of ovarian fluid (indicator of presence of broken eggs) and pH, and 2) there is a decrease in ovarian fluid pH after addition of broken eggs. We found a negative relationship between the turbidity and ovarian fluid pH. Addition of the content of broken eggs to ovarian fluid caused a decrease of pH and a decrease in ovarian fluid ability to activate sperm motility. Therefore it can be suggested that content of broken eggs decreases or negates the ability of ovarian fluid to activate sperm motility due to a decrease of pH. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A coalescence-based maximum-likelihood method is presented that aims to (i) detect diversity-reducing events in the recent history of a population and (ii) distinguish between demographic (e.g., bottlenecks) and selective causes (selective sweep) of a recent reduction of genetic variability. The former goal is achieved by taking account of the distortion in the shape of gene genealogies generated by diversity-reducing events: gene trees tend to be more star-like than under the standard coalescent. The latter issue is addressed by comparing patterns between loci: demographic events apply to the whole genome whereas selective events affect distinct regions of the genome to a varying extent. The maximum-likelihood approach allows one to estimate the time and strength of diversity-reducing events and to choose among competing hypotheses. An application to sequence data from an African population of Drosophila melanogaster shows that the bottleneck hypothesis is unlikely and that one or several selective sweeps probably occurred in the recent history of this population.},

abstract = {A simple inexpensive method of determining level of ploidy in fish using silver-stained cell preparations is evaluated. The method involves determining the maximum number of nucleoli per cell on silver-stained slides. Any tissue can be used since whole cells, rather than chromosomes are required for analysis. Since the amount of tissue needed to make slides is very small, samples may be obtained from fish about 7-8 cm long without sacrificing the animal. Results from three salmonid species (rainbow trout, chinook salmon and coho salmon) showed that haploid individuals had one nucleolus/cell, diploid individuals had one or two nucleoli/cell and triploid individuals had 1, 2 or 3 nucleoli/cell. The fraction of cells with three nucleoli/cell was higher in triploid embryos (averaging 75{\%}) than in gill tissue from triploid fish of 6 months or 2 years of age (averaging 43{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively). However, no cells with three nucleoli were ever found in diploid individuals, making identification of triploids unambiguous. This method should be applicable to most fish species since the majority of those examined have been shown to have only one chromosome with a nucleolar organizer region (NOR) per haploid genome. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {Social, cooperative breeding behaviour is rare in spiders and generally characterized by inbreeding, skewed sex ratios and high rates of colony turnover, processes that when combined may reduce genetic variation and lower individual fitness quickly. On these grounds, social spider species have been suggested to be unstable in evolutionary time, and hence sociality a rare phenomenon in spiders. Based on a partial molecular phylogeny of the genus Stegodyphus, we address the hypothesis that social spiders in this genus are evolutionary transient. We estimate the age of the three social species, test whether they represent an ancestral or derived state and assess diversification relative to subsocial congeners. Intraspecific sequence divergence was high in all of the social species, lending no support for the idea that they are young, transient species. The age of the social lineages, constant lineage branching and the likelihood that social species are independently derived suggest that either the social species are 'caught in sociality' or they have evolved into cryptic species.},

abstract = {In this simulation study, the effect of the mating scheme on genetic gain and inbreeding has been explored for aquaculture selection programs where tank effects and large family sizes are common. Different selection methods were investigated (individual, family, sib, combined and within-family selection). Our results suggest that under family and sib selection, genetic gain was increased with assortative mating in comparison to random mating. The advantage of assortative mating increased when common environmental effects were present. Contrarily, a decrease in genetic gain was observed with disassortative mating, except for the case of within-family selection. The advantage of assortative mating over random mating was due to the increase in the between-family component of the additive genetic variance that was exacerbated with the presence of common environmental effects. Under family and sib selection, the join effect of assortative mating and common environmental effects produced an increase in genetic gain of around 80 and 40{\%} at early generations, and around 10 and 60{\%} at later generations, respectively. Inbreeding was low under family selection for all mating schemes but much higher under sib selection when assortative mating was performed. In fact, the inbreeding coefficient after 10 generations of selection was 300{\%} higher when assortative matings were performed under sib selection, compared to random matings. This was due to the fact that under sib selection, matings were based on family means, leading to an increased frequency of within-family matings. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the effect of the mating scheme on genetic gain and inbreeding in an aquaculture context where family sizes are large and tank effects are present, and shows that assortative mating can substantially enhance the response to selection, particularly when family selection methods are applied. Statement of relevance Our article complies with the Policy Statement for submission of manuscripts to the Genetics Section, as it provides insight into the issue of breeding programs. Here, we have connected previous work in the field to address new questions, focusing on how the mating scheme may affect both genetic gain and inbreeding in aquaculture selection programs, where family sizes are typically large and tank effects are usually present. In fish species, it is possible to consider different mating schemes because fecundity is high and because in vitro fertilization is often possible. A particular problem in aquaculture breeding programs is the impossibility of tagging physically newborn individuals. Given this, a common practice in aquaculture is to rear families in separate tanks until the fish are large enough to be individually tagged. This introduces an environmental effect common to the members of the same family (tank effect) which can lead to a reduction of the response to selection that needs to be considered. We studied here the efficiency of different selection methods in terms of genetic gain and inbreeding and investigated the effect of the mating scheme to optimize breeding programs in aquaculture when tank effects are present. We have shown that assortative mating can substantially enhance the response to selection, particularly when family selection methods are applied and tank effects are present. To our knowledge, the effect of the mating scheme in an aquaculture context has never been addressed before. Our results suggest that assortative mating in the presence of common environmental variance may be considered in selection programs in aquaculture. Our conclusions will help breeders make optimal mating choices.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has established that innate immunity is a skillful system that detects invasion of microbial pathogens. Recognition of microbial components by TLRs initiates signal transduction pathways, which triggers expression of genes. These gene products control innate immune responses and further instruct development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. TLR signaling pathways are finely regulated by TIR domain-containing adaptors, such as MyD88, TIRAP/Mal, TRIF and TRAM. Differential utilization of these TIR domain-containing adaptors provides specificity of individual TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Several mechanisms have been elucidated that negatively control TLR signaling pathways, and thereby prevent overactivation of innate immunity leading to fatal immune disorders. The involvement of TLR-mediated pathways in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been proposed. Thus, TLR-mediated activation of innate immunity controls not only host defense against pathogens but also immune disorders.},

Despite their importance for understanding global ecological and evolutionary processes, plant-animal interaction gradients are particularly difficult to test systematically across large geographic gradients, and evidence from smaller, disparate studies is inconclusive. By systematically measuring post-dispersal seed predation using 6980 standardized seed depots along 18 mountains in the Pacific cordillera, we found that seed predation increases 18{\%} from the Arctic to Equator and 16{\%} from 4000 masl to sea level. Clines in total predation, likely driven by invertebrates, were consistent across tree-line ecotones and in continuous forest, and were better explained by climate seasonality than by productivity, biodiversity, or latitude. These results suggest that species interactions play predictably greater ecological and evolutionary roles in tropical, lowland, and other less seasonal ecosystems.},

Inbreeding coefficients for 182 nonendemic and 28 endemic island populations were estimated from allozyme and microsatellite heterozygosities in island and related mainland populations. Island populations were significantly inbred, with inbreeding coefficients significantly higher in endemic than nonendemic island populations.

abstract = {Theoretical studies of adaptation have exploded over the past decade. This work has been inspired by recent, surprising findings in the experimental study of adaptation. For example, morphological evolution sometimes involves a modest number of genetic changes, with some individual changes having a large effect on the phenotype or fitness. Here I survey the history of adaptation theory, focusing on the rise and fall of various views over the past century and the reasons for the slow development of a mature theory of adaptation. I also discuss the challenges that face contemporary theories of adaptation.},

abstract = {Single locus neutralist models predict that population size bottlenecks will reduce genetic variation and increase inbreeding, thereby reducing evolutionary potential. However, experimental evaluations of the effects of bottlenecks on quantitative genetic variation do not always follow predictions, espe- cially for characters related to reproductive fitness. Populations of Drosophila melanogaster were sub- jected to population bottlenecks of a single pair for one or three generations, and their ability to tolerate increasing concentrations of NaCl was compared with those of their outbred base popula- tions, and related highly inbred lines. Bottlenecked populations became extinct at significantly lower concentrations of NaCl than their non-bottlenecked base populations. Population bottlenecks should be avoided in managing species of conservation concern.},

Using all available vertebrate TLR protein sequences, we inferred the phylogenetic tree and then characterized critical amino acid residues for functional divergence by detecting altered functional constraints after gene duplications. We found that the extracellular domain of TLR genes showed higher functional divergence than that of the cytoplasmic domain, particularly in the region between leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 10 and LRR 15 of TLR 4. Our finding supports the concept that sequence evolution in the extracellular domain may be responsible for the broad diversity of TLR ligand-binding affinity, providing a testable hypothesis for potential targets that could be verified by further experimentation.},

abstract = {In most human populations, the ability to digest lactose contained in milk usually disappears in childhood, but in European-derived populations, lactase activity frequently persists into adulthood (Scrimshaw and Murray 1988). It has been suggested (Cavalli-Sforza 1973; Hollox et al. 2001; Enattah et al. 2002; Poulter et al. 2003) that a selective advantage based on additional nutrition from dairy explains these genetically determined population differences (Simoons 1970; Kretchmer 1971; Scrimshaw and Murray 1988; Enattah et al. 2002), but formal population-genetics-based evidence of selection has not yet been provided. To assess the population-genetics evidence for selection, we typed 101 single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering 3.2 Mb around the lactase gene. In northern European-derived populations, two alleles that are tightly associated with lactase persistence (Enattah et al. 2002) uniquely mark a common ({\~{}}77{\%}) haplotype that extends largely undisrupted for {\textgreater}1 Mb. We provide two new lines of genetic evidence that this long, common haplotype arose rapidly due to recent selection: (1) by use of the traditional F(ST) measure and a novel test based on p(excess), we demonstrate large frequency differences among populations for the persistence-associated markers and for flanking markers throughout the haplotype, and (2) we show that the haplotype is unusually long, given its high frequency--a hallmark of recent selection. We estimate that strong selection occurred within the past 5,000-10,000 years, consistent with an advantage to lactase persistence in the setting of dairy farming; the signals of selection we observe are among the strongest yet seen for any gene in the genome.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The study of how phenology may contribute to the assembly of plant communities has a long history in ecology. Climate change has brought renewed interest in this area, with many studies examining how phenology may contribute to the success of exotic species. In particular, there is increasing evidence that exotic species occupy unique phenological niches and track climate change more closely than native species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Here, we use long-term records of species' first flowering dates from fi ve northern hemisphere temperate sites (Chinnor, UK and in the United States, Concord, Massachusetts; Fargo, North Dakota; Konza Prairie, Kansas; and Washington,D.C.) to examine whether invaders have distinct phenologies. Using a broad phylogenetic framework, we tested for differences between exotic and native species in mean annual flowering time, phenological changes in response to temperature and precipitation,and longer-term shifts in first flowering dates during recent pronounced climate change (“flowering time shifts”).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Across North American sites, exotic species have shifted flowering with climate change while native species, on average, have not. In the three mesic systems, exotic species exhibited higher tracking of interannual variation in temperature,such that flowering advances more with warming, than native species. Across the two grassland systems, however, exotic species differed from native species primarily in responses to precipitation and soil moisture, not temperature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide cross-site support for the role of phenology and climate change in explaining species' invasions.Further, they support recent evidence that exotic species may be important drivers of extended growing seasons observed with climate change in North America.},

abstract = {Climatologists tell us that Earth's climate is changing (1): It currently seems clear that a warmer climate is developing in the northern hemisphere, and that the weather will become more variable (2, 3). As part of this global change, seasonal patterns are being altered to make spring conditions occur earlier in the year in the north (4), without necessarily corresponding changes in more southern latitudes (5). We know much less about the ecological effects of such climate changes. Studying recent changes (6) and fluctuations (7) over the last few decades may help us improve our understanding of ecological responses to climate changes. This is the approach taken by Winkler et al. (8), in this issue of PNAS, in their study of the consequences of climate-induced shifts in breeding date on one of the most important life history traits in birds: clutch size (8). Their contribution adds to a rapidly growing literature on ecology–climate interactions (6, 7). Phenology, a key feature in the article by Winkler et al. (8), is the study of seasonal plant and animal activity driven by environmental factors (4). The phenology of a species is typically evolved through natural selection to match the environmental conditions to maximize its fitness (9). In the temperate region, reproduction in birds starts in late spring or early summer, although timing often varies depending on climate. The effect of climate on the phenology, and in particular the timing of reproduction, is well known for plants, amphibians, and birds (10–12). These studies have demonstrated that onset of reproduction in spring may have advanced by a week or two due to recent changes in climate over much of North America and Europe (6, 7). We know much less about the implications of such phenological changes on the population dynamics of the species. Winkler et al. (8) are among the first to ask: (i) what are the consequences of earlier egg-laying on demographic rates (such as clutch size and survival)? (ii) To what extent do phenological changes in one species match changes in the rest of the environment? (iii) Finally, are the relationships between climate, phenology, and other life history traits simply linear, or are these relationships nonlinear? Here we highlight these three issues and suggest a more general framework, within which such ecological responses to climate change might be studied.},

We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunkiaeran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian).

abstract = {Disease resistance (R) genes are found in plants as either simple (single allelic series) loci, or more frequently as complex loci of tandemly repeated genes. These different loci are likely to be under similar evolutionary forces from pathogens, but the contrast between them suggests important differences in mechanisms associated with DNA structure and recombination that generate and maintain R gene diversity. The RPP13 locus in Arabidopsis represents an important paradigm for studying the evolution of an R gene at a simple locus. The RPP13 allele from the accession Nd-1, designated RPP13-Nd, confers resistance to five different isolates of the biotrophic oomycete, Peronospora parasitica (causal agent of downy mildew), and encodes an NBS-LRR type R protein with a putative amino-terminal leucine zipper. The RPP13-Rld allele, cloned from the accession Rld-2, encodes a different specificity. Comparison of three RPP13 alleles revealed a high rate of amino acid divergence within the LRR domain, less than 80{\%} identity overall, compared to the remainder of the protein ({\textgreater} 95{\%} identity). We also found evidence for positive selection in the LRR domain for amino acid diversification outside the core conserved beta-strand/beta-turn motif, suggesting that more of the LRR structure is available for interaction with target molecules than has previously been reported for other R gene products. Furthermore, an amino acid sequence (LLRVLDL) identical in an LRR among RPP13 alleles is conserved in other LZ NBS-LRR type R proteins, suggesting functional significance.},

abstract = {Advancing phenology in response to global warming has been reported across biomes1,2, raising concerns about the temporal uncoupling of trophic interactions3,4. Concurrently, widely reported flower visitor declines have been linked to resource limitations5. Phenological responses in the Arctic have been shown to outpace responses from lower latitudes and recent studies suggest that differences between such responses for plants and their flower visitors could be particularly pronounced in the Arctic1,6. The evidence for phenological uncoupling is scant because relevant data sets are lacking7 or not available at a relevant spatial scale8. Here, we present evidence of a climate-associated shortening of the flowering season and a concomitant decline in flower visitor abundance based on a long-term, spatially replicated (1996–2009) data set from high-Arctic Greenland. A unique feature of the data set is the spatial and temporal overlap of independent observations of plant and insect phenology. The shortening of the flowering season arose through spatial variation in phenological responses to warming. The shorter flowering seasons may have played a role in the observed decline in flower visitor abundance. Our results demonstrate that the dramatic climatic changes currently taking place in the Arctic are strongly affecting individual species and ecological communities, with implications for trophic interactions.

abstract = {Population bottlenecks can restrict variation at functional genes, reducing the ability of populations to adapt to new and changing environments. Understanding how populations generate adaptive genetic variation following bottlenecks is therefore central to evolutionary biology. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are ideal models for studying adaptive genetic variation due to their central role in pathogen recognition. While de novo MHC sequence variation is generated by point mutation, gene conversion can generate new haplotypes by transferring sections of DNA within and across duplicated MHC loci. However, the extent to which gene conversion generates new MHC haplotypes in wild populations is poorly understood. We developed a 454 sequencing protocol to screen MHC class I exon 3 variation across all 13 island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii). We reveal that just 11-15 MHC haplotypes were retained when the Berthelot's pipit dispersed across its island range in the North Atlantic ca. 75,000 years ago. Since then, at least 26 new haplotypes have been generated in situ across populations. We show that most of these haplotypes were generated by gene conversion across divergent lineages, and that the rate of gene conversion exceeded that of point mutation by an order of magnitude. Gene conversion resulted in significantly more changes at nucleotide sites directly involved with pathogen recognition, indicating selection for functional variants. We suggest that the creation of new variants by gene conversion is the predominant mechanism generating MHC variation in genetically depauperate populations, thus allowing them to respond to pathogenic challenges.},

abstract = {Selective breeding has been very successful in increasing production in Atlantic salmon. Gene technology opens new opportunities to comprehend the nature of the genetic variation underlying production traits. Two major areas in which gene technology may play an important role are (1) production of genetically modified fish and (2) development and utilization of genetic markers. Several studies of transgenic salmonids have shown substantially increased growth rates. However, many different issues are related to whether genetically modified fish should be used or not. Genetic markers can be used for aquaculture purposes and for monitoring wild populations. Construction of genetic maps based on markers enables the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and/or markers linked to them. This will facilitate marker-assisted selection, enabling improvement in economically important traits, in particular traits difficult to breed for, such as food conversion efficiency and disease resistance. Several experiments aimed at mapping QTL in salmonids using genetic markers are ongoing. DNA marker technologies can also be used for identification and monitoring of lines, families and individuals, and for genetic improvement through selection for favourable genes and gene combinations.},

abstract = {TLR4 and MD-2 form a heterodimer that recognizes LPS (lipopolysaccharide) from Gram-negative bacteria. Eritoran is an analog of LPS that antagonizes its activity by binding to the TLR4-MD-2 complex. We determined the structure of the full-length ectodomain of the mouse TLR4 and MD-2 complex. We also produced a series of hybrids of human TLR4 and hagfish VLR and determined their structures with and without bound MD-2 and Eritoran. TLR4 is an atypical member of the LRR family and is composed of N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The $\beta$ sheet of the central domain shows unusually small radii and large twist angles. MD-2 binds to the concave surface of the N-terminal and central domains. The interaction with Eritoran is mediated by a hydrophobic internal pocket in MD-2. Based on structural analysis and mutagenesis experiments on MD-2 and TLR4, we propose a model of TLR4-MD-2 dimerization induced by LPS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Silverstein2009,
abstract = {The objectives of this study were to estimate the heritabilities for and genetic correlations among resistance to bacterial cold-water disease and growth traits in a population of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Bacterial cold-water disease, a chronic disease of rainbow trout, is caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum. This bacterium also causes acute losses in young fish, known as rainbow trout fry syndrome. Selective breeding for increased disease resistance is a promising strategy that has not been widely used in aquaculture. At the same time, improving growth performance is critical for efficient production. At the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture, reducing the negative impact of diseases on rainbow trout culture and improving growth performance are primary objectives. In 2005, when fish averaged 2.4 g, 71 full-sib families were challenged with F. psychrophilum and evaluated for 21 d. Overall survival was 29.3{\%} and family rates of survival varied from 1.5 to 72.5{\%}. Heritability of postchallenge survival, an indicator of disease resistance, was estimated to be 0.35 +/- 0.09. Body weights at 9 and 12 mo posthatch and growth rate from 9 to 12 mo were evaluated on siblings of the fish in the disease challenge study. Growth traits were moderately heritable, from 0.32 for growth rate to 0.61 for 12-mo BW. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between growth traits and resistance to bacterial cold-water disease were not different from zero. These results suggest that genetic improvement can be made simultaneously for growth and bacterial cold-water disease resistance in rainbow trout by using selective breeding.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. A new disease in farmed rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) was described in Norway in 2013. The disease mainly affected the heart and resembled heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). HSMI is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and a search for a similar virus in the diseased rainbow trout led to detection of a sequence with 85{\%} similarity to PRV. This finding called for a targeted effort to assess the risk the new PRV-variant pose on farmed rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon by studying infection and disease pathogenesis, aiming to provide more diagnostic knowledge. Based on the genetic relationship to PRV, the novel virus is referred to as PRV-Oncorhynchus mykiss (PRV-Om) in contrast to PRV-Salmo salar (PRV-Ss). In experimental trials, intraperitoneally injected PRV-Om was shown to replicate in blood in both salmonid species, but more effectively in rainbow trout. In rainbow trout, the virus levels peaked in blood and heart of cohabitants 6 weeks post challenge, along with increased expression of antiviral genes (Mx and viperin) in the spleen, with 80–100{\%} of the cohabitants infected. Heart inflammation was diagnosed in all cohabitants examined 8 weeks post challenge. In contrast, less than 50{\%} of the Atlantic salmon cohabitants were infected between 8 and 16 weeks post challenge and the antiviral response in these fish was very low. From 12 weeks post challenge and onwards, mild focal myocarditis was demonstrated in a few virus-positive salmon. In conclusion, PRV-Om infects both salmonid species, but faster transmission, more notable antiviral response and more prominent heart pathology were observed in rainbow trout.},

abstract = {Little is known about the genetic basis of ecologically important morphological variation such as the diverse color patterns of mammals. Here we identify genetic changes contributing to an adaptive difference in color pattern between two subspecies of oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus). One mainland subspecies has a cryptic dark brown dorsal coat, while a younger beach-dwelling subspecies has a lighter coat produced by natural selection for camouflage on pale coastal sand dunes. Using genome-wide linkage mapping, we identified three chromosomal regions (two of major and one of minor effect) associated with differences in pigmentation traits. Two candidate genes, the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) and its antagonist, the Agouti signaling protein (Agouti), map to independent regions that together are responsible for most of the difference in pigmentation between subspecies. A derived mutation in the coding region of Mc1r, rather than change in its expression level, contributes to light pigmentation. Conversely, beach mice have a derived increase in Agouti mRNA expression but no changes in protein sequence. These two genes also interact epistatically: the phenotypic effects of Mc1r are visible only in genetic backgrounds containing the derived Agouti allele. These results demonstrate that cryptic coloration can be based largely on a few interacting genes of major effect.},

abstract = {Changes in environmental conditions can rapidly shift allele frequencies in populations of species with relatively short generation times. Frequency shifts might be detectable in neutral genetic markers when stressful conditions cause a population decline. However, frequency shifts that are diagnostic of specific conditions depend on isolating sets of genes that are involved in adaptive responses. Shifts at candidate loci underlying adaptive responses and DNA regions that control their expression have now been linked to evolutionary responses to pollution, global warming and other changes. Conversely, adaptive constraints, particularly in physiological traits, are recognized through DNA decay in candidate genes. These approaches help researchers and conservation managers understand the power and constraints of evolution.},

@article{Matsushima2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a central role in innate immunity. TLRs are membrane glycoproteins and contain leucine rich repeat (LRR) motif in the ectodomain. TLRs recognize and respond to molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, flagellin, and RNA from bacteria or viruses. The LRR domains in TLRs have been inferred to be responsible for molecular recognition. All LRRs include the highly conserved segment, LxxLxLxxNxL, in which "L" is Leu, Ile, Val, or Phe and "N" is Asn, Thr, Ser, or Cys and "x" is any amino acid. There are seven classes of LRRs including "typical" ("T") and "bacterial" ("S"). All known domain structures adopt an arc or horseshoe shape. Vertebrate TLRs form six major families. The repeat numbers of LRRs and their "phasing" in TLRs differ with isoforms and species; they are aligned differently in various databases. We identified and aligned LRRs in TLRs by a new method described here. RESULTS: The new method utilizes known LRR structures to recognize and align new LRR motifs in TLRs and incorporates multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions. TLRs from thirty-four vertebrate were analyzed. The repeat numbers of the LRRs ranges from 16 to 28. The LRRs found in TLRs frequently consists of LxxLxLxxNxLxxLxxxxF/LxxLxx ("T") and sometimes short motifs including LxxLxLxxNxLxxLPx(x)LPxx ("S"). The TLR7 family (TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) contain 27 LRRs. The LRRs at the N-terminal part have a super-motif of STT with about 80 residues. The super-repeat is represented by STTSTTSTT or {\_}TTSTTSTT. The LRRs in TLRs form one or two horseshoe domains and are mostly flanked by two cysteine clusters including two or four cysteine residue. CONCLUSION: Each of the six major TLR families is characterized by their constituent LRR motifs, their repeat numbers, and their patterns of cysteine clusters. The central parts of the TLR1 and TLR7 families and of TLR4 have more irregular or longer LRR motifs. These central parts are inferred to play a key role in the structure and/or function of their TLRs. Furthermore, the super-repeat in the TLR7 family suggests strongly that "bacterial" and "typical" LRRs evolved from a common precursor.},

When used in conjunction with the program CERVUS, this system provided sufficient power to assign maternity and paternity within the Seychelles warbler, despite the complications associated with its cooperative breeding system and a relatively low level of genetic variation. Parentage analyses showed that subordinate 'helper' females as well as the dominant 'primary' females laid eggs in communal nests, indicating that the Seychelles warbler has an intermediate level of female reproductive skew, in between the alternative extremes of helper-at-the-nest and joint nesting systems. Forty-four per cent of helpers bred successfully, accounting for 15{\%} of all offspring. Forty per cent of young resulted from extra-group paternity.},

Here I review the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk. Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although TLRs are critical for host defense, it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of TLR signaling, as well as recognition of self molecules by TLRs, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, it is now clear that the interaction between TLRs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. Here we describe the recent advances that have been made by research into the role of TLR biology in host defense and disease.},

abstract = {Ocean physics plays a central role in structuring the large-scale patterns and functioning of ocean ecosystems, and climate variability impacts marine biota in a wide variety of ways. Primary production by phytoplankton forms the base of the pelagic-ocean food web and is modulated by temperature, nutrient supply, light, and mixed layer depth. Temperature influences a host of organism physiological rates, and temperature and circulation are determining factors in the geographic ranges of many marine species. Climate variations alter predator-prey interactions, interspecies competition, the seasonal timing of biological events or phenology, the spread of diseases, parasites and invasive species, and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nutrients, and many trace chemicals. Ocean biology, in turn, can affect climate by influencing the atmospheric composition of radiatively important trace gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and dimethyl sulfide; chlorophyll also modifies the vertical absorption profile of solar radiation and thus influences sea-surface temperature and mixed layer depth. Based on historical observations, biological effects are already evident in response to anthropogenic ocean warming and sea-ice melt. Future climate change impacts are expected to grow in magnitude due to further warming and other physical changes as well as synergistic effects with other human stressors such as ocean acidification, deoxygenation, and coastal nutrient eutrophication. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Analysis of the genomes of two distantly related bird species, chicken and zebra finch (divergence of about 100 million years), indicate that there are ten avian toll-like receptors and that five of these, TLR2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5 and 7, are clear orthologs to TLRs found in mammals. Duplication of genes has led to TLR1La and 1Lb, TLR2a and 2b, and two TLR7s in the zebra finch. Avian TLR21 may be orthologous to TLR21 found in fish and amphibians, and avian TLR15, which is phylogenetically related to the TLR2 family, appears to be unique to avian species. While TLR2 is conserved between mammalian and avian species, the other TLR2 family members evolved independently. Dimerization between either of the two avian TLR2 species and TLR1La or 1Lb permits recognition of the same broad range of molecules as recognized by mammalian TLR2 dimerized with either TLR1, 6 and 10. Similarly, while TLR9 has been lost from the avian genome, DNA high in unmethylated CpG motifs is immunostimulatory through avian TLR21 which is absent in mammals. Thus, while some TLR members were commonly retained in both mammals and birds, others were separately lost or gained, or diverged independently; but broadly speaking the TLRs of the two classes of vertebrates evolved to recognize very similar spectra of microbial products. Components of downstream TLR signaling are also mostly conserved but with some losses in avian species; notably, TRAM is absent in avian genomes and, hence, the TRIF/TRAM-dependent signaling pathway utilized by mammals in LPS activation appears to be absent in birds.},

@article{Bonin2007,
abstract = {In conservation biology genetic diversity is recognized as an important criterion to consider when prioritizing populations for protection. Today, population genomics offers the opportunity to evaluate both neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity directly at the genome level with molecular tools. By screening the genome with many genetic markers, it is possible to detect loci supposedly under natural selection and thus of adaptive significance. We devised a new diversity index, the population adaptive index (PAI), which accounts for the adaptive value of the population it refers to. To estimate this index, we performed a genome scan with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to identify neutral and selected loci in several populations of a widespread amphibian (common frog, Rana temporaria) and a threatened plant (Austrian dragonhead, Dracocephalum austriacum L.). We then investigated four different conservation strategies aimed at protecting the maximum amount of genetic diversity (neutral or selected). In particular we explored the relevance of the principle of complementarity, usually applied to the protection of species, in the management of intraspecific diversity. This principle advocates the conservation of sets of units that together maximize the species' or genetic diversity, which is in opposition to the traditional approach of targeting populations that are the most diverse individually. Four major conclusions emerged from these results. First, the PAI seemed to be a valuable index to evaluate the adaptive diversities within populations. Second, in the two species, the neutral and adaptive diversities within and among populations were not correlated, so conservation strategies based on the neutral and adaptive indexes would not select the same populations for protection. Third, because of its efficiency in conserving genetic diversity, the principle of complementarity deserves to be used more often for this purpose. Fourth, when neutral and adaptive results conflict, additional arguments (e.g., demography, ecology, and geographic proximity) should be considered together with levels of genetic diversity to determine a conservation strategy.},

abstract = {Genetic host factors play a substantial role in susceptibility to and severity of malaria, which continues to cause at least one million deaths per year. Recently, members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family have been shown to be involved in recognition of the etiologic organism Plasmodium falciparum: The glycosylphosphatidylinisitol anchor induces signaling in host cells via TLR-2 and -4, while hemozoin-induced immune activation involves TLR-9. Binding of microbial ligands to the respective TLRs triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the TLR/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain and may contribute to the host response, including pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and malarial fever. In a case-control study among 870 Ghanaian children, we examined the influence of TLR-2, -4, and -9 polymorphisms in susceptibility to severe malaria. TLR-2 variants common in Caucasians and Asians were completely absent. However, we found a new, rare mutation (Leu658Pro), which impairs signaling via TLR-2. We failed to detect any polymorphisms within the TLR-9/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Two frequent TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms did not show a clear association with malaria severity. In contrast, the TLR-4-Asp299Gly variant occurred at a high rate of 17.6{\%} in healthy controls, and was even more frequent in severe malaria patients (24.1{\%}, p{\textless}0.05). Likewise, TLR-4-Thr399Ile was seen in 2.4{\%} of healthy children and in 6.2{\%} of patients (p=0.02). TLR-4-Asp299Gly and TLR-4-Thr399Ile conferred an 1.5- and 2.6-fold increased risk of severe malaria, respectively. These findings suggest TLR4-mediated responses to malaria in vivo and TLR-4 polymorphisms to be associated with disease manifestation. However some gray areas also suggest the scope for further improvements.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLR) are membrane-bound sensors of the innate immune system that recognize invariant and distinctive molecular features of invading microbes and are also essential for initiating adaptive immunity in vertebrates. The genetic variation at TLR genes has been directly related to differential pathogen outcomes in humans and livestock. Nonetheless, new insights about the impact of TLRs polymorphism on the evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases can be gained through the investigation of additional vertebrate groups not yet investigated in detail. In this study, we have conducted the first characterization of the entire TLR multigene family (N = 10 genes) in non-model avian species. Using primers targeting conserved coding regions, we aimed at amplifying large segments of the extracellular domains (275-435 aa) involved in pathogen recognition across seven phylogenetically diverse bird species. Our analyses suggest avian TLRs are dominated by stabilizing selection, suggesting that slow rates of nonsynonymous substitution help preserve biological function. Overall, mean values of $\omega$ (= d(n)/d(s)) at each TLR locus ranged from 0.196 to 0.517. However, we also found patterns of positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites that could be linked to species-specific differences in pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition. Only 39 of 2,875 (∼1.35{\%}) of the codons analyzed exhibited significant patterns of positive selection. At least one half of these positively selected codons can be mapped to putative ligand-binding regions, as suggested by crystallographic structures of TLRs and their ligands and mutagenic analyses. We also surveyed TLR polymorphism in wild populations of two bird species, the Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni and the House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus. In general, avian TLRs displayed low to moderate single nucleotide polymorphism levels and an excess of silent nucleotide substitutions, but also conspicuous instances of positive directional selection. In particular, TLR5 and TLR15 exhibited the highest degree of genetic polymorphism and the highest occurrence of nonconservative amino acid substitutions. This study provides critical primers and a first look at the evolutionary patterns and implications of TLR polymorphism in non-model avian species and extends the list of candidate loci for avian eco-immunogenetics beyond the widely employed genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).},

abstract = {Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection--an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (http://www.datamonkey.org/).},

The task has an immense practical value with many applications in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, as large quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at relatively low cost. In this paper, we address the unsupervised learning problem in the context of detecting the main foreground objects in single images. We train a student deep network to predict the output of a teacher pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in videos or large image collections. Our approach is different from published methods on unsupervised object discovery. We move the unsupervised learning phase during training time, then at test time we apply the standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This strategy has the benefit of allowing increased generalization possibilities during training, while remaining fast at testing. Our unsupervised learning algorithm can run over several generations of student-teacher training. Thus, a group of student networks trained in the first generation collectively create the teacher at the next generation. In experiments our method achieves top results on three current datasets for object discovery in video, unsupervised image segmentation and saliency detection. At test time the proposed system is fast, being one to two orders of magnitude faster than published unsupervised methods.},

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as the PRRs in mammals and play an essential role in the recognition of microbial components. The TLRs may also recognize endogenous ligands induced during the inflammatory response. Similar cytoplasmic domains allow TLRs to use the same signaling molecules used by the interleukin 1 receptors (IL-1Rs): these include MyD88, IL-1R-associated protein kinase and tumor necrosis factor receptor-activated factor 6. However, evidence is accumulating that the signaling pathways associated with each TLR are not identical and may, therefore, result in different biological responses.},

abstract = {Discerning the relative roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species, as well as how these processes interact, is a fundamental aim in biology. Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations (isolation by distance), of colonization history and founder effects (isolation by colonization) or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations (isolation by adaptation). Here, we attempt to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos. Using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation, we reveal that the northward colonization of this species ca. 8500 years ago resulted in genetic bottlenecks in the colonized archipelagos. We then show that high levels of genetic structure exist across archipelagos and that these are consistent with a pattern of isolation by colonization, but not with isolation by distance or adaptation. Finally, we show that substantial morphological divergence also exists and that this is strongly concordant with patterns of genetic structure and bottleneck history, but not with environmental differences or geographic distance. Overall, our data suggest that founder effects are responsible for both genetic and phenotypic changes across archipelagos. Our findings provide a rare example of how founder effects can persist over evolutionary timescales and suggest that they may play an important role in the early stages of speciation.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors mediate immune responses via recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Polymorphisms of toll-like receptors may affect their recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to varied host resistance to pathogenic infections. However, little is known about the polymorphisms of chicken toll-like receptors (ChTLR) among breeds. In this study, we cloned ChTLR2 type 1 and type 2 genes from 7 chicken breeds and analyzed their sequences. It was found that there were 10 amino acid polymorphism sites in ChTLR2 type 1 and type 2, among which 6 sites were in type 1 (5 sites in the extracellular domain and 1 site in the cytoplasmic domain) and 4 sites were in type 2 (all 4 sites in the extracellular domain). These results demonstrate that ChTLR2 type 1 and type 2 genes are polymorphic among chicken breeds, suggesting a varied resistance among breeds of chicken. We found that Laiwu Black chicken breeds have distinctive polymorphic sites at I699T in the type 1 and H561R in the type 2 ChTLR2 gene. Beijing Fatty chickens have distinctive sites at Q45R in type 1 and V66L in type 2. Nongda No.3 Chickens have distinctive sites at L115P, H232Y, and T494A in type 1. Hy-Line variety brown chickens have distinctive sites at I311V in type 2. Beijing White 939 chickens have distinctive sites at E284G in type 1 and A22V in type 2. These findings may provide some clues toward understanding the resistance of lighter chickens to salmonellosis.},

abstract = {Automatically triggered cameras taking photographs or videos of passing animals (camera traps) have emerged over the last decade as one of the most powerful tool for wildlife research. In parallel, a wealth of camera trap systems and models has become commercially available, a phenomenon mainly driven by the increased use of camera traps by sport hunters. This has raised the need for developing criteria to choose the suitable camera trap model in relation to a range of factors, primarily the study aim, but also target species, habitat, trapping site, climate and any other aspect that affects camera performance. There is also fragmented information on the fundamentals of sampling designs that deploy camera trapping, such as number of sampling sites, spatial arrangement and sampling duration. In this review, we describe the relevant technological features of camera traps and propose a set of the key ones to be evaluated when choosing camera models. These features are camera specifications such as trigger speed, sensor sensitivity, detection zone, flash type and flash intensity, power autonomy, and related specifications. We then outline sampling design and camera features for the implementation of major camera trapping applications, specifically: (1) faunal inventories, (2) occupancy studies, (3) density estimation through Capture-Mark-Recapture and (4) density estimation through the Random Encounter Model. We also review a range of currently available models and stress the need for standardized testing of camera models that should be frequently updated and widely distributed. Finally we summarize the "ultimate camera trap", as desired by wildlife biologists, and the current technological limitations of camera traps in relation to their potential for a number of emerging applications.},

abstract = {Similar to mammalian species, chickens show marked immunological responses to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) both in vivo and in vitro. In mammals, the receptor for ODNs has been demonstrated to be TLR9; however, an orthologue to mammalian TLR9 is absent in the chicken genome. In this study, chicken TLRs 7, 15 and 21 were expressed in mammalian HEK-293T cells; expression of TLR21 but not TLR7 or 15 resulted in marked NF-??B activation upon stimulation with exogenous ODN. This activation was not observed when cells were stimulated by TLR agonists other than ODNs. In addition, responsiveness of the ectopically expressed TLR21 demonstrated similar kinetics of activation as reported for mammalian TLR9 and was dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the ODN. The same ODN specificity was observed for chicken HD11 macrophage when ODN mediated activation was monitored by up-regulation of IL1, IL6 and iNOS transcripts. Furthermore, when TLR21, but not TLR15, was partially silenced in HD11 cells by RNA interference, ODN mediated responses were reduced. TLR21-mediated NF-??B activation in HEK-293T cells was inhibited by bafilomycin A suggesting that endosomal maturation is required for TLR21 activation and observations by confocal microscopy and digestion with endoglycosidase H suggest TLR21 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of resting cells. Expression of TLR21 transcripts was found in all chicken tissues examined but was significantly less in the lung and small intestine of newly hatched birds. Two of the leucine rich repeat regions (LRRs) of TLR21 showed homology with a LRR conserved within mammalian TLR9 and implicated in ligand binding. We hypothesize that avian TLR21 plays a similar role to that of mammalian TLR9 and enables recognition of microbial DNA as a danger signal resulting in downstream innate and adaptive immune responses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Heritable variation in fitness is the fuel of adaptive evolution, and sex can generate new adaptive combinations of alleles. If the generation of beneficial combinations drives the evolution of recombination, then the level of recombination should result in changes in the response to selection. Three types of lines of Drosophila melanogaster varying in their level of genetic recombination were selected over 38 generations for geotaxis. The within-chromosome recombination level of these lines was controlled for 60{\%} of the genome: chromosome X and chromosome II. The full recombination lines had normal, unmanipulated levels of recombination on these two chromosomes. Conversely, nonrecombination lines had recombination effectively eliminated within the X and second chromosomes. Finally, partial recombination lines had the effective rate of within-chromosome recombination lowered to 10{\%} of natural levels for these two chromosomes. The rate of response to selection was measured for continuous negative geotaxis and for a fluctuating environment (alternating selection for negative and positive geotaxis). All selected Drosophila lines responded to selection and approximately 36{\%} of the response to selection was because of the X and second chromosomes. However, recombination did not accelerate adaptation during either directional or fluctuating selection for geotaxis.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of conserved pattern-recognition molecules responsible for initiating innate and acquired immune responses. Because they play a key role in host defence, these genes have received increasing interest in the evolutionary and population genetics literature, as their variation represents a potential target of adaptive evolution. However, the role of pathogen-mediated selection (i.e. episodic positive selection) in the evolution of these genes remains poorly known and has not been examined outside of mammals. A recent increase in the number of bird species for which TLR sequences are available has enabled us to examine the selective processes that have influenced evolution of the 10 known avian TLR genes. Specifically, we tested for episodic positive selection to identify codons that experience purifying selection for the majority of their evolution, interspersed with bursts of positive selection that may occur only in restricted lineages. We included up to 23 species per gene (mean = 16.0) and observed that, although purifying selection was evident, an average of 4.5{\%} of codons experienced episodic positive selection across all loci. For four genes in which sequence coverage traversed both the extracellular leucine-rich repeat region (LRR) and transmembrane/intracellular domains of the proteins, increased positive selection was observed at the extracellular domain, consistent with theoretical predictions. Our results provide evidence that episodic positive selection has played an important role in the evolution of most avian TLRs, consistent with the role of these loci in pathogen recognition and a mechanism of host-pathogen coevolution.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to improve post-thaw quality of cryopreserved rainbow trout semen. Quality was assessed by measuring sperm motility and fertilization rates at the eyed, hatching, and swim-up larvae stages. We first tested how varying glucose concentrations in a methanol extender (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. M, n= 9 different males per concentration) and different semen-extender ratios (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1, n= 3 males and in a separate experiment 1:3 and 1:5, n= 6) affected post-thaw motility. Sperm motility and fertilization rates of samples with 0.18. M glucose in 9{\%} methanol as an extender, a 1:5 sperm-to-extender ratio, and a 15. min equilibration period then were measured at sperm-to-egg ratios of 100,000, 300,000, and 600,000:1. The optimal cryopreservation conditions were found to be 0.15. M glucose in the extender, a 15. min equilibration period, and a 1:5 semen-to-extender ratio. This combination resulted in high post-thaw motility (49.9{\%}) and hatching rates (67.1. ±. 18.7, 78.6. ±. 17.0, and 84.4. ±. 10.0{\%} for sperm-to-egg ratios of 100,000, 300,000 and 600,000:1, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the post-thaw fertilization ability of rainbow trout semen can be similar to that of fresh semen at a sperm-to-egg ratio as low as 600,000:1. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

H{\'{a}} v{\'{a}}rias raz{\~{o}}es pelas quais os acad{\^{e}}micos, os internos, os residentes e os estudantes de p{\'{o}}s-gradua{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e at{\'{e}} mesmo os m{\'{e}}dicos profissionalmente mais experientes podem n{\~{a}}o avan{\c{c}}ar do resumo em congresso para o artigo completo em um peri{\'{o}}dico cient{\'{i}}fico, por{\'{e}}m, muito provavelmente, a mais importante {\'{e}} a dificuldade na reda{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos apenas 25-30 par{\'{a}}grafos que comp{\~{o}}em um artigo original. Diante de uma folha de papel vazia ou de um cursor piscando em uma p{\'{a}}gina em branco do processador de texto na tela do monitor, muitos param e desistem. Em artigo anterior 3 , analisamos e sugerimos aprimoramentos para o processo de revis{\~{a}}o por pares. No presente ponto de vista, propomos uma estrat{\'{e}}gia pr{\'{a}}tica de sistematiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da reda{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos par{\'{a}}grafos cient{\'{i}}ficos, visando simplificar essa tarefa. Pretende-se, assim, aumentar a taxa de publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o como artigo completo de muitos dos excelentes resumos de comunica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es apresentadas anualmente nos principais congressos m{\'{e}}dicos e facilitar o atualmente congestionado processo de revis{\~{a}}o por pares. O formato da comunica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o cient{\'{i}}fica vem evoluindo bastante ao longo dos s{\'{e}}culos 4-7 , tornando a leitura mais objetiva e padronizada. Dentro desse processo, destaca-se a formata{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o IMRaD 4,5,7 , sigla derivada das iniciais das principais se{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es do artigo -introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, m{\'{e}}todos, resultados e discuss{\~{a}}o. Ao longo do s{\'{e}}culo XX, o formato IMRaD passou a ser cada vez mais utilizado, representando cerca de 10{\%} dos artigos na d{\'{e}}cada de 1950, passando a predominar nos anos 1960 e alcan{\c{c}}ando 80{\%} nos anos 1970 7 . Atualmente, o IMRaD {\'{e}} o formato recomendado e adotado pelos principais peri{\'{o}}dicos cient{\'{i}}ficos da {\'{a}}rea m{\'{e}}dica de todo o mundo, incluindo os Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia (ABC). Al{\'{e}}m da formata{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o IMRaD, o artigo original submetido para publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o deve atender a normas e regras espec{\'{i}}ficas de cada um dos peri{\'{o}}dicos. Ainda que tenda a prevalecer um padr{\~{a}}o razoavelmente uniforme, diferen{\c{c}}as existem e devem ser observadas por ocasi{\~{a}}o da reda{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Por exemplo, o n{\'{u}}mero de palavras {\'{e}} limitado a 4.500 nos ABC e a 5.000 no JACC, incluindo o texto propriamente dito e as refer{\^{e}}ncias. Considerando que a parte das refer{\^{e}}ncias, em geral limitadas a 30-40, usa cerca de mil palavras, sobram algo como 3.500-4.000 para o corpo do texto, ou seja, para serem utilizados nos 25-30 par{\'{a}}grafos do IMRaD, correspondendo a cerca de 130 palavras cada um. Na busca por evid{\^{e}}ncias e dados objetivos, foram analisados, como amostra de conveni{\^{e}}ncia, todos os artigos originais publicados nos n{\'{u}}meros de janeiro de 2012 e de 2013 dos ABC e do JACC (neste somente os dois primeiros n{\'{u}}meros desses meses). Observou-se uma tend{\^{e}}ncia bastante clara para o n{\'{u}}mero total de par{\'{a}}grafos e para a sua distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos par{\'{a}}grafos pelas quatro se{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es do IMRaD de um artigo. Para os 20 artigos dos ABC e os 34 artigos do JACC, o n{\'{u}}mero m{\'{e}}dio de par{\'{a}}grafos foi de 28,9 e de 28,2 (p = 0,703), respectivamente, com 1/3 deles contendo 25-30 par{\'{a}}grafos e 57{\%} do total de artigos com o total de 22-33 par{\'{a}}grafos. Essa relativa const{\^{a}}ncia {\'{e}} bastante interessante de observar e destacar, considerando que os t{\'{o}}picos e {\'{a}}reas abordados, assim como a forma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e at{\'{e}} mesmo a nacionalidade dos autores, s{\~{a}}o bastante diversos. Sendo assim, corrobora-se a ideia de que existe um formato b{\'{a}}sico a ser seguido para uma efetiva publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. A Figura 1 ilustra a distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos par{\'{a}}grafos para as diversas se{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es do IMRaD nos dois peri{\'{o}}dicos analisados. Embora haja alguma variabilidade entre os artigos, a introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} claramente a se{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com menor n{\'{u}}mero de par{\'{a}}grafos (p {\textless} 0,001), enquanto h{\'{a}} certo equil{\'{i}}brio entre as demais se{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es (p {\textgreater} 0,05), especialmente para os artigos originais do JACC, no qual as se{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de m{\'{e}}todos, resultados e discuss{\~{a}}o tendem a ter entre oito e nove par{\'{a}}grafos. Quando s{\~{a}}o comparadas as distribui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de par{\'{a}}grafos entre os ABC e o JACC, verifica-se que a introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e a discuss{\~{a}}o tendem a ter mais par{\'{a}}grafos nos ABC do que no JACC, respectivamente, 3,8 versus 2,4 (p {\textless} 0,01) e 10,4 versus 8,8 (p = 0,04).

abstract = {For ecologists, understanding the reaction of animals to environmental changes is critical. Using networked sensor technology to measure wildlife and environmental parameters can provide accurate, real-time and comprehensive data for monitoring, research and conservation of wildlife. This paper reviews: (i) conventional detection technology; (ii) concepts and applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in animal ecology; and (iii) the advantages and disadvantages of IoT. The current theoretical limits of IoT in animal ecology are also discussed. Although IoT offers a new direction in animal ecological research, it still needs to be further explored and developed as a theoretical system and applied to the appropriate scientific frameworks for understanding animal ecology. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

Although measuring the recombination rate is experimentally challenging, good estimates can be obtained by applying population-genetic methods to DNA sequences taken from natural populations. Statistical methods are now providing insights into the nature and scale of variation in the recombination rate, particularly in humans.

Ecologists often use image capture to bolster data collection in time and space. However, the ability to process these images remains a bottleneck. Computer vision can greatly increase the efficiency, repeatability and accuracy of image review. Computer vision uses image features, such as colour, shape and texture to infer image content. I provide a brief primer on ecological computer vision to outline its goals, tools and applications to animal ecology. I reviewed 187 existing applications of computer vision and divided articles into ecological description, counting and identity tasks. I discuss recommendations for enhancing the collaboration between ecologists and computer scientists and highlight areas for future growth of automated image analysis.},

The first division frequency of electroporated zygotes (54.6{\%}) was slightly lower than that of freshly isolated, unelectroporated zygotes (61.2{\%}); both these values were higher than that of enzymes isolated by enzymatic maceration (30.5{\%}). The electroporated zygotes could develop into globular proembryos, but the frequency at which this occurred (3.1{\%}) was much lower than that shown by the unelectroporated zygotes (8.7{\%}). Introduced green flourescent protein (GFP) gene constructs showed transient expression in about 2.6{\%} of the electroporated tobacco zygotes.},

abstract = {Predation by exotic species has caused the extinction of many native animal species on islands, whereas competition from exotic plants has caused few native plant extinctions. Exotic plant addition to islands is highly nonrandom, with an almost perfect 1 to 1 match between the number of naturalized and native plant species on oceanic islands. Here, we evaluate several alternative implications of these findings. Does the consistency of increase in plant richness across islands imply that a saturation point in species richness has been reached? If not, should we expect total plant richness to continue to increase as new species are added? Finally, is the rarity of native plant extinctions to date a misleading measure of the impact of past invasions, one that hides an extinction debt that will be paid in the future? By analyzing historical records, we show that the number of naturalized plant species has increased linearly over time on many individual islands. Further, the mean ratio of naturalized to native plant species across islands has changed steadily for nearly two centuries. These patterns suggest that many more species will become naturalized on islands in the future. We also discuss how dynamics of invasion bear upon alternative saturation scenarios and the implications these scenarios have for the future retention or extinction of native plant species. Finally, we identify invasion-motivated research gaps (propagule pressure, time-lags to extinction, abundance shifts, and loss of area) that can aid in forecasting extinction and in developing a more comprehensive theory of species extinctions.},

abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are considered a paradigm of adaptive evolution at the molecular level and as such are frequently investigated by evolutionary biologists and ecologists. Accurate genotyping is essential for understanding of the role that MHC variation plays in natural populations, but may be extremely challenging. Here, I discuss the DNA-based methods currently used for genotyping MHC in non-model vertebrates, as well as techniques likely to find widespread use in the future. I also highlight the aspects of MHC structure that are relevant for genotyping, and detail the challenges posed by the complex genomic organization and high sequence variation of MHC loci. Special emphasis is placed on designing appropriate PCR primers, accounting for artefacts and the problem of genotyping alleles from multiple, co-amplifying loci, a strategy which is frequently necessary due to the structure of the MHC. The suitability of typing techniques is compared in various research situations, strategies for efficient genotyping are discussed and areas of likely progress in future are identified. This review addresses the well established typing methods such as the Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP), Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), Reference Strand Conformational Analysis (RSCA) and cloning of PCR products. In addition, it includes the intriguing possibility of direct amplicon sequencing followed by the computational inference of alleles and also next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies; the latter technique may, in the future, find widespread use in typing complex multilocus MHC systems.},

abstract = {The use of selective breeding is still relatively limited in aquaculture species. Information on such activities is sparse, hindering an overall evaluation of their success. Here, we report on the results of an online survey of the major aquaculture breeding companies operating in Europe. Six main reared fish species were targeted. A total of 31 respondents contributed to the survey, representing 75 {\%} of European breeding organi-zations. Family-based breeding schemes were predominant, but individual selection was more frequently applied in marine species. Artificial fertilization is the preferred means of reproduction; however, mass spawning is often used as a fallback method. The most frequently selected trait is growth performance, but the number of selected traits has been increasing over the years through the addition of traits such as disease resistance or product quality. The use of molecular tools is now common in all programs, mainly for pedigree traceability. An increasing number of programs use either genomic or marker-assisted selection. Results related to the seed production market confirmed that for Atlantic salmon there are a few dominant players at the European level, with 30–50 {\%} market share. Only part of the European fish aquaculture industry today fully exploits selective breeding to the best advantage. A larger impact assessment still needs to be made by the remainder, particularly on the market share of fish seed (eggs, larvae or juveniles) and its conse-quences for hatchery stability.},

abstract = {The evolutionary mechanisms generating the tremendous biodiversity of islands have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. Genetic drift and divergent selection are pre- dicted to be strong on islands and both could drive population divergence and specia- tion. Alternatively, strong genetic drift may preclude adaptation. We conducted a genomic analysis to test the roles of genetic drift and divergent selection in causing genetic differentiation among populations of the island fox (Urocyon littoralis). This species consists of six subspecies, each of which occupies a different California Chan- nel Island. Analysis of 5293 SNP loci generated using Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing found support for genetic drift as the dominant evolutionary mech- anism driving population divergence among island fox populations. In particular, pop- ulations had exceptionally low genetic variation, small Ne (range = 2.1–89.7; median = 19.4), and significant genetic signatures of bottlenecks. Moreover, islands with the lowest genetic variation (and, by inference, the strongest historical genetic drift) were most genetically differentiated from mainland grey foxes, and vice versa, indicating genetic drift drives genome-wide divergence. Nonetheless, outlier tests identified 3.6–6.6{\%} of loci as high FST outliers, suggesting that despite strong genetic drift, divergent selection contributes to population divergence. Patterns of similarity among populations based on high FST outliers mirrored patterns based on morphology, providing additional evidence that outliers reflect adaptive divergence. Extremely low genetic variation and small Ne in some island fox populations, particularly on San Nicolas Island, suggest that they may be vulnerable to fixation of deleterious alleles, decreased fitness and reduced adaptive potential.

abstract = {The potential for investigating immune gene diversity has been greatly enhanced by recent advances in sequencing power. In this study, variation at two categories of avian immune genes with differing functional roles, pathogen detection and mediation of immune mechanisms, was examined using high-throughput sequencing. TLRs identify and alert the immune system by detecting molecular motifs that are conserved among pathogenic microorganisms, whereas cytokines act as mediators of resulting inflammation and immunity. Nine genes from each class were resequenced in a panel of domestic chickens and wild jungle fowl (JF). Tests on population-wide genetic variation between the gene classes indicated that allele frequency spectra at each group were distinctive. TLRs showed evidence pointing toward directional selection, whereas cytokines had signals more suggestive of frequency-dependent selection. This difference persisted between the distributions considering only coding sites, suggesting functional relevance. The unique patterns of variation at each gene class may be constrained by their different functional roles in the immune response. TLRs identify a relatively limited number of exogeneous pathogenic-related patterns and would be required to adapt quickly in response to evolving novel microbes encountered in new environmental niches. In contrast, cytokines interact with many molecules in mediating the power of immune mechanisms, and accordingly respond to the selective stimuli of many infectious diseases. Analyses also indicated that a general pattern of high variability has been enhanced by widespread genetic exchange between chicken and red JF, and possibly between chicken and gray JF at TLR1LA and TLR2A.},

abstract = {1. Finding, counting and identifying animals is a central challenge in ecology. Most studies are limited by the time and cost of fieldwork by human observers. To increase the spatial and temporal breadth of sampling, ecologists are adopting passive image-based monitoring approaches. While passive monitoring can expand data collection, a remaining obstacle is finding the small proportion of images containing ecological objects among the majority of frames containing only background scenes. 2. I proposed a scene-specific convolutional neural network for detecting animals of interest within long duration time-lapse videos. Convolutional neural networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that have recently made significant advances in image classification. 3. The approach was tested on videos of floral visitation by hummingbirds. Despite low frame rates, poor image quality, and complex video conditions, the model correctly classified over 90{\%} of frames containing hummingbirds. Combining motion detection and image classification can substantially reduce the time investment in scoring images from passive monitoring studies. 4. These results underscore the promise of deep learning to lead ecology into greater automation using passive image analysis. To help facilitate future applications, I created a desktop executable that can be used to apply pre-trained models to videos, as well as reproducible scripts for training new models on local and cloud environments.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important part in the innate immune recognition of invading microorganisms, initiating sufficient immune responses. Growing amounts of data suggest that the ability of certain individuals to respond properly to TLR ligands may be impaired by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TLR genes, resulting in an altered susceptibility to, or course of, infectious or inflammatory disease. Most studies have focused on two cosegregating SNPs-Asp299gly and Thr399Ile-within the gene encoding TLR4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These SNPs are present in approximately 10{\%} of white individuals, and have been found to be positively correlated with several infectious diseases. However, these SNPs seem to protect from atherosclerosis and related diseases, which is reviewed in this article also. Meanwhile, SNPs of genes encoding other TLRs-eg, TLR2, which recognises a wide variety of microbial ligands-have been reported, and preliminary studies indicate an impact on susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases as well. This review summarises and discusses the results obtained, and draws conclusions from these data.},

abstract = {Translocations are an increasingly common tool in conservation. The maintenance of genetic diversity through translocation is critical for both the short- and long-term persistence of populations and species. However, the relative spatio-temporal impacts of translocations on neutral and functional genetic diversity, and how this affects genetic structure among the conserved populations overall, have received little investigation. We compared the impact of translocating different numbers of founders on both microsatellite and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I diversity over a 23-year period in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). We found low and stable microsatellite and MHC diversity in the source population and evidence for only a limited loss of either type of diversity in the four new populations. However, we found evidence of significant, but low to moderate, genetic differentiation between populations, with those populations established with fewer founders clustering separately. Stochastic genetic capture (as opposed to subsequent drift) was the main determinant of translocated population diversity. Furthermore, a strong correlation between microsatellite and MHC differentiation suggested that neutral processes outweighed selection in shaping MHC diversity in the new populations. These data provide important insights into how to optimize the use of translocation as a conservation tool.},

abstract = {Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is involved in the biosynthesis of lignin, a component of plant cell wall which negatively impacts paper pulp processing and biomass fermentation to ethanol. Transgenic poplars with depressed CAD activity show structural alterations of lignin. Natural CAD mutants have been identified in several plants; however, no natural CAD mutants have been identified in poplar. We surveyed the natural genetic variation in CAD4, a gene coding for CAD, in 360 poplar trees from Western Europe. We measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), performed neutrality tests and estimated diversity indexes, and investigated their dependence from sample size. We identified 45 SNPs, six of which caused an amino acid substitution. Our results suggest a short span of LD in Populus nigra CAD4 gene. We identified carriers of different nonsynonymous SNPs in CAD4; those subjects are candidate to be used in classical breeding programs to obtain carriers of different combinations of functional polymorphisms. We showed that use of small sample size might lead to biased estimates of LD, neutrality tests, and diversity indexes.},

abstract = {The molecular basis for Toll-like receptor (TLR) recognition of microbial ligands is unknown. We demonstrate that mouse and human TLR5 discriminate between different flagellins, and we use this difference to map the flagellin recognition site on TLR5 to 228 amino acids of the extracellular domain. Through molecular modeling of the TLR5 ectodomain, we identify two conserved surface-exposed regions. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that naturally occurring amino acid variation in TLR5 residue 268 is responsible for human and mouse discrimination between flagellin molecules. Mutations within one conserved surface identify residues D295 and D367 as important for flagellin recognition. These studies localize flagellin recognition to a conserved surface on the modeled TLR5 structure, providing detailed analysis of the interaction of a TLR with its ligand. These findings suggest that ligand binding at the beta sheets results in TLR activation and provide a new framework for understanding TLR-agonist interactions.},

abstract = {As populations become increasingly fragmented, managers are often faced with the dilemma that intentional hybridization might save a population from inbreeding depression but it might also induce outbreeding depression. While empirical evidence for inbreeding depression is vastly greater than that for outbreeding depression, the available data suggest that risks of outbreeding, particularly in the second generation, are on par with the risks of inbreeding. Predicting the relative risks in any particular situation is complicated by variation among taxa, characters being measured, level of divergence between hybridizing populations, mating history, environmental conditions and the potential for inbreeding and outbreeding effects to be occurring simultaneously. Further work on consequences of interpopulation hybridization is sorely needed with particular emphasis on the taxonomic scope, the duration of fitness problems and the joint effects of inbreeding and outbreeding. Meanwhile, managers can minimize the risks of both inbreeding and outbreeding by using intentional hybridization only for populations clearly suffering from inbreeding depression, maximizing the genetic and adaptive similarity between populations, and testing the effects of hybridization for at least two generations whenever possible.},

abstract = {The rapidly warming temperatures in high-latitude and alpine regions have the potential to alter the phenology of Arctic and alpine plants, affecting processes ranging from food webs to ecosystem trace gas fluxes. The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was initiated in 1990 to evaluate the effects of expected rapid changes in temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth and community changes using experimental warming. Here, we used the ITEX control data to test the phenological responses to background temperature variation across sites spanning latitudinal and moisture gradients. The dataset overall did not show an advance in phenology; instead, temperature variability during the years sampled and an absence of warming at some sites resulted in mixed responses. Phenological transitions of high Arctic plants clearly occurred at lower heat sum thresholds than those of low Arctic and alpine plants. However, sensitivity to temperature change was similar among plants from the different climate zones. Plants of different communities and growth forms differed for some phenological responses. Heat sums associated with flowering and greening appear to have increased over time. These results point to a complex suite of changes in plant communities and ecosystem function in high latitudes and elevations as the climate warms.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play prominent roles in initiating immune responses to infection, but their roles in particular cell types in vivo are not established. Here we report the generation of mice selectively lacking the crucial TLR-signaling adaptor MyD88 in dendritic cells (DCs). In these mice, the early production of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-12, was substantially reduced after TLR stimulation. Whereas the innate interferon-?? response of natural killer cells and of natural killer T cells and the Th1 polarization of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were severely compromised after treatment with a soluble TLR9 ligand, they were largely intact after administration of an aggregated TLR9 ligand. These results demonstrate that the physical form of a TLR ligand affects which cells can respond to it and that DCs and other innate immune cells can respond via TLRs and collaborate in promoting Th1 adaptive immune responses to an aggregated stimulus. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The life-threatening complications of sepsis in humans are elicited by infection with Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria. Recently, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major biologically active agent of Gram-negative bacteria, was shown to mediate cellular activation by a member of the human Toll-like receptor family, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. Here we investigate the mechanism of cellular activation by soluble peptidoglycan (sPGN) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), main stimulatory components of Gram-positive bacteria. Like LPS, sPGN and LTA bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein CD14 and induce activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in host cells like macrophages. We show that whole Gram-positive bacteria, sPGN and LTA induce the activation of NF-kappaB in HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 but not in cells expressing TLR1 or TLR4. The sPGN- and LTA-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by polymyxin B, an antibiotic that binds and neutralizes LPS. Coexpression together with membrane CD14 enhances sPGN signal transmission through TLR2. In contrast to LPS signaling, activation of TLR2 by sPGN and LTA does not require serum. These findings identify TLR2 as a signal transducer for sPGN and LTA in addition to LPS.},

abstract = {The innate immune system in drosophila and mammals senses the invasion of microorganisms using the family of Toll receptors, stimulation of which initiates a range of host defense mechanisms. In drosophila antimicrobial responses rely on two signaling pathways: the Toll pathway and the IMD pathway. In mammals there are at least 10 members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that recognize specific components conserved among microorganisms. Activation of the TLRs leads not only to the induction of inflammatory responses but also to the development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. The TLR-induced inflammatory response is dependent on a common signaling pathway that is mediated by the adaptor molecule MyD88. However, there is evidence for additional pathways that mediate TLR ligand-specific biological responses.},

Throughout evolution, animal species have been continually afflicted with devasting disease outbreaks which have influenced the demographic and genetic status of the populations. Some general population consequences of such epidemics include selection for disease resistance, the occasional alteration of host gene frequencies by a genetic "founder effect" after an outbreak, and genetic adaptation of parasites to abrogate host defense mechanisms. A wide variety of host cellular genes which are polymorphic within species and which confer a regulatory effect on the outcome of infectious diseases has recently been discovered.

abstract = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS{\textgreater}1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In farmed fish, selective breeding for feed conversion ratio (FCR) may be possible via indirectly selecting for easily-measured indicator traits correlated with FCR. We tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout with low lipid{\%} have genetically better FCR, and that lipid{\%} may be genetically related to retention efficiency of macronutrients, making lipid{\%} a useful indicator trait. A quantitative genetic analysis was used to quantify the benefit of replacing feed intake in a selection index with one of three lipid traits: body lipid{\%}, muscle lipid{\%} or viscera{\%} weight of total body weight (reflecting visceral lipid). The index theory calculations showed that simultaneous selection for weight gain and against feed intake (direct selection to improve FCR) increased the expected genetic response in FCR by 1{\textperiodcentered}50-fold compared with the sole selection for growth. Replacing feed intake in the selection index with body lipid{\%}, muscle lipid{\%} or viscera{\%} increased genetic response in FCR by 1{\textperiodcentered}29-, 1{\textperiodcentered}49- and 1{\textperiodcentered}02-fold, respectively, compared with the sole selection for growth. Consequently, indirect selection for weight gain and against muscle lipid{\%} was almost as effective as direct selection for FCR. Fish with genetically low body and muscle lipid{\%} were more efficient in turning ingested protein into protein weight gain. Both physiological and genetic mechanisms promote the hypothesis that low-lipid{\%} fish are more efficient. These results highlight that in breeding programmes of rainbow trout, control of lipid deposition improves not only FCR but also protein-retention efficiency. This improves resource efficiency of aquaculture and reduces nutrient load to the environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection are poorly understood. It has been proposed that their expression is controlled by the non-clonal, or innate, component of immunity that preceded in evolution the development of an adaptive immune system in vertebrates. We report here the cloning and characterization of a human homologue of the Drosophila toll protein (Toll) which has been shown to induce the innate immune response in adult Drosophila. Like Drosophila Toll, human Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor. Both Drosophila Toll and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the NF-kappaB pathway. We show that a constitutively active mutant of human Toll transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of NF-kappaB-controlled genes for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1, which is required for the activation of naive T cells.},

The data provide indirect information in the form of annual landed catch, age distri-bution, index of relative abundance, and biological features like length, weight, and maturity at age. Other possible data include tag recoveries, juvenile sur-veys, and acoustic estimates of absolute abundance. Due to these diverse data types, as well as economic importance, fisheries stock assessment has pushed the limits of applied statistics over the last fifty years. The dynamic models are highly nonlinear, include dozens of parameters, and the objective function con-sists of several likelihood components. The most efficient algorithm to fit these models is automatic differentiation, as implemented with AD Model Builder, a dialect of C ++ . To diagnose the model fit, trellis plots in R have proven very useful, and the coda package is used to diagnose MCMC convergence. Here, I demonstrate the functions I have implemented to make these tasks easier, both for newcomers to R and old dogs.},

abstract = {When a selectively favourable gene substitution occurs in a population, changes in gene frequencies will occur at closely linked loci. In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

abstract = {Females should prefer to be fertilized by males that increase the genetic quality of their offspring. In vertebrates, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the acquired immune response and have been shown to affect mating preferences. They are therefore important candidates for the link between mate choice and indirect genetic benefits. Higher MHC diversity may be advantageous because this allows a wider range of pathogens to be detected and combated. Furthermore, individuals harbouring rare MHC alleles might better resist pathogen variants that have evolved to evade common MHC alleles. In the Seychelles warbler, females paired with low MHC-diversity males elevate the MHC diversity of their offspring to levels comparable to the population mean by gaining extra-pair fertilizations. Here, we investigate whether increased MHC diversity results in higher life expectancy and whether there are any additional benefits of extra-pair fertilizations. Our 10-year study found a positive association between MHC diversity and juvenile survival, but no additional survival advantage of extra-pair fertilizations. In addition, offspring with a specific allele (Ase-ua4) had a fivefold longer life expectancy than offspring without this allele. Consequently, the interacting effects of sexual selection and pathogen-mediated viability selection appear to be important for maintaining MHC variation in the Seychelles warbler. Our study supports the prediction that MHC-dependent extra-pair fertilizations result in genetic benefits for offspring in natural populations. However, such genetic benefits might be hidden and not necessarily apparent in the widely used fitness comparison of extra- and within-pair offspring.},

abstract = {Colony-dwelling social spiders of the genus Stegodyphus are characterized by high colony turnover, within-colony mating, inbreeding and skewed sex ratios. These phenomena may purge genetic variation from the entire species gene pool. Social Stegodyphus have previously been discussed as ecologically unstable and evolutionary dead ends. We investigated the distribution and age (sequence divergence) of mitochondrial DNA variation for inferences of colony propagation, colony discreteness and maintenance of genetic variation in the social spider S. dumicola. In contrast to our expectations, we found abundant mtDNA variation, consisting of 15 haplotypes belonging to four haplotype lineages. Lineage divergence ranged between 2.75 and 6{\%} for the gene ND1. Nearly all colonies (86{\%}) were monomorphic and even neighbour colonies showed fixed differences. Simulations show that genetic drift in multifounder colonies cannot alone explain monomorphism within colonies. Haplotypes in polymorphic colonies and from neighbouring colonies were always genealogically similar. Monomorphism and the genealogical pattern among colonies suggest 'clonal' colony propagation involving single matrilineages. The divergence of haplotype lineages and distribution of haplotypes imply that colony turnover is not high enough to purge genetic variation in the species gene pool, and that S. dumicola as a species is old enough to question the instability (in ecological time) of a social spider.

abstract = {Although microsatellite polymorphisms are one of the most commonly used tools in genetic analyses, it remains to be understood how microsatellite DNA has evolved as a ubiquitous and highly abundant class of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes. On the basis of analyses of spontaneous human microsatellite mutations of germline origin, I show here that different mutation biases underlie the evolution of microsatellite repeats. The within-locus mutation rate increases with allele length, but is not affected by the size difference between an individual's two alleles (allele span). Within loci, long alleles tend to mutate to shorter lengths, thereby acting to prevent infinite growth. Expansions are more common than contractions among dinucleotide repeats, whereas no such trend is evident among tetranucleotide repeats. This observation is consistent with the longer repeat lengths and higher frequency of di- compared with tetranucleotide repeats. An excess of paternally transmitted mutations (male-to-female ratio of 4.9) supports a male-biased mutation rate in the human genome.},

abstract = {The role of inbreeding depression in the extinction of wild populations is controversial, largely because there are no quantitative estimates of its impact using realistic levels of inbreeding depression. To address this deficiency, this study (1) provides a comprehensive estimate of the impact of inbreeding depression on wild, mammalian and avian species via a meta-analysis, and (2) determines the impact of this level of inbreeding depression on extinction risk over a broad taxonomic range via stochastic computer projections with and without inbreeding depression for populations with carrying capacities of 100, 500 and 2000 individuals. An average overall effect of 12 diploid lethal equivalents was found across the life-history of the species in the meta-analysis. In the stochastic computer projections, 12 diploid lethal equivalents of inbreeding depression (with purging) decreased median times to extinction by an average of 37{\%}. These decreases were significant and of very similar magnitude, regardless of the carrying capacity modelled. Disregarding the influence of inbreeding depression on extinction risk will lead to serious overestimates of the survival prospects of threatened mammalian and avian taxa. Further, inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if the causes of extinction risk and their relative contributions are not recognized. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Polymorphisms of TLR5 may affect their recognition of bacterial flagellin, leading to varied host resistance to pathogenic infections. Here, we cloned TLR5 genes from Common Pheasant, Guinea fowl and 9 Chicken breeds and analyzed their sequences. The open reading frames of TLR5 were sequenced. Amino acid analysis indicated that TLR5 from Chicken breeds shared 99.4-99.9{\%} homology. The amino acid homology of TLR5 ranged from 92.1 to 92.5{\%} between Chickens and Guinea fowl, 95.7-96.1{\%} between Chickens and Turkey, 94.3-94.7{\%} between Chickens and Common Pheasant, and 79.9-80.1{\%} between Chickens and Zebra-finch. Different genetic patterns were determined among Chickens, Common Pheasant, Guinea fowl, Turkey and Zebra-finch. It was found that there were 92 amino acid polymorphic sites, among which 5 sites in chicken TLR5, 63 sites in Guinea fowl TLR5 and 44 sites in Common Pheasant TLR5. Our data indicate that the positive Darwinian selection occurred in avian TLR5 genes since frequency of non-synonymous (d ( N )) {\textgreater} frequency of synonymous (d ( S )). These results also demonstrate that avian TLR5 genes are polymorphic among avian breeds, suggesting a varied resistance among breeds of avian. This information might be of help to improve the health of avian by breeding and vaccination.},

abstract = {Insects are particularly vulnerable to rapid environmental changes, which are disproportionally affecting high latitudes. Increased temperature could influence insect species differentially and reshape assemblages over time. We quantified temporal assemblage turnover of Arctic Diptera (flies) in the Muscidae, one of the most diverse and abundant families of Arctic insects, using time series data from Zackenberg, north-east Greenland. We measured temporal patterns of abundance, diversity, and composition of muscid assemblages in wet fen, mesic and arid heath habitats from yearly collections spanning 1996?2014 and tested their relationship to climate. A total of 18 385 individuals representing 16 species of muscid flies were identified. A significant decrease of 80{\%} of total muscid abundance was observed during the study period. Species richness declined in each habitat type but this trend was not significant across habitats. The number of common and abundant species also decreased significantly over time across habitats revealing a temporal modification of species evenness. Significant temporal changes in composition observed in the wet fen and across habitats were mainly driven by a change in relative abundance of certain species rather than by species replacement. Shift in composition in each habitat and decline in muscid abundance across habitats were associated with summer temperature, which has significantly increased over the study period. However, relationships between temperature and muscid abundance at the species level were noticeable for a few species only. Significant directional change in composition was documented in the wet fen but no biotic homogenization across habitats was observed. As one of the few studies of species-level changes in abundance, diversity and composition of an insect taxon in the Arctic over the past two decades, our study shows that habitat types may modulate insect species responses to recent climate change and that contrasting species responses can alter species assemblages within a few decades.},

We show that there is significantly more linkage disequilibrium on the X chromosome than on chromosome arm 3R and much more linkage disequilibrium on both chromosomes than expected from estimates of recombination rates, mutation rates, and levels of diversity. To explore what types of evolutionary models might explain this observation, we examine a model of recurrent, nonoverlapping selective sweeps and a model of a recent drastic bottleneck (e.g., founder event) in the demographic history of North American populations of D. simulans. The simple sweep model is not consistent with the observed patterns of linkage disequilibrium nor with the observed frequencies of segregating mutations. Under a restricted range of parameter values, a simple bottleneck model is consistent with multiple facets of the data. While our results do not exclude some influence of selection on X vs. autosome variability levels, they suggest that demography alone may account for patterns of linkage disequilibrium and the frequency spectrum of segregating mutations in this population of D. simulans.},

However, few predictors of a population's response to inbreeding are found reliable. The models are most likely to detect inbreeding depression in large populations, that is, in populations in which their statistical power is maximised. Purging was found to be significant in 14 populations and a significant trend of purging was found across populations. The change in inbreeding depression due to purging averaged across the 119 populations is {\textless}1{\%}, however, suggesting that the fitness benefits of purging are rarely appreciable. The study re-emphasises the necessity to avoid inbreeding in captive breeding programmes and shows that purging cannot be relied upon to remove deleterious alleles from zoo populations.},

Herein, we report emergence of TLR5 pseudogene in several phylogenetic lineages of passerine birds (Aves: Passeriformes). Out of 47 species examined in this study 18 possessed a TLR5 pseudogene. Phylogenetic analysis together with the type of mutation responsible for pseudogenization indicate that TLR5 pseudogene emerged at least seven times independently in passerines. Lack of any functional copy of the gene has been verified based on TLR5 mRNA blood expression in four species representing the four main passerine lineages possessing the TLR5 pseudogene. Our results suggest that the non-functional TLR5 variant is fixed in those lineages or, at least, that individuals homozygote in the TLR5 pseudogene are frequent in the investigated species. Further research is needed to assess the impact of the TLR5 loss on immunological performance in birds. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In malaria-endemic regions, Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnancy is a predominant cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Primiparae are relatively immune-na{\"{i}}ve and particularly prone. Innate immune recognition of P. falciparum is partly mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR-4 and -9 influence manifestation. Recognition via TLR-2, which functions as heterodimer with TLR-1 or TLR-6, appears to be essential but in previous studies from Ghana, functional TLR-2 SNPs were virtually absent. In the present study, we assessed two well characterized TLR-1 polymorphisms, rs4833095 (S248N) and rs5743618 (I602S), among 302 primiparous Ghanaian women, and analysed associations with P. falciparum infection and manifestation. The prevalence of the TLR-1 S248N variant was 20.5{\%}, whereas the TLR-1 I602S variant was rare at 2{\%}. Placental P. falciparum infection was observed in 78{\%} of women heterozygous for the TLR-1 S248N SNP but in 63{\%} of women with the respective wildtype (P= 0.03). Furthermore, the odds of malaria-associated anaemia were more than doubled in TLR-1 S248N heterozygous women (P= 0.03) although parasite densities did not differ. No differences in the rates of low birth weight and preterm delivery were observed. These data support that TLR-1 is involved in the recognition of P. falciparum and indicate its role in susceptibility to and manifestation of malaria in pregnancy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change has led to shifts in phenology in many species distributed widely across taxonomic groups. It is, however, unclear how we should interpret these shifts without some sort of a yardstick: a measure that will reflect how much a species should be shifting to match the change in its environment caused by climate change. Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species' food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton. In almost all of these examples, the phenology of the focal species shifts either too little (five out of 11) or too much (three out of 11) compared to the yardstick. Thus, many species are becoming mistimed due to climate change. We urge researchers with long-term datasets on phenology to link their data with those that may serve as a yardstick, because documentation of the incidence of climate change-induced mistiming is crucial in assessing the impact of global climate change on the natural world.},

Although recent genome-wide studies have identified candidate regions under selection, it is not yet clear how natural selection has shaped population differentiation. Here, we have analyzed the degree of population differentiation at 2.8 million Phase II HapMap single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We find that negative selection has globally reduced population differentiation at amino acid-altering mutations, particularly in disease-related genes. Conversely, positive selection has ensured the regional adaptation of human populations by increasing population differentiation in gene regions, primarily at nonsynonymous and 5'-UTR variants. Our analyses identify a fraction of loci that have contributed, and probably still contribute, to the morphological and disease-related phenotypic diversity of current human populations.},

abstract = {The San Nicolas Island fox (Urocyon littoralis dickeyi) is genetically the most monomorphic sexually reproducing animal population yet reported and has no variation in hypervariable genetic markers. Such low levels of variation imply lower resistance to pathogens, reduced fitness, and problems in distinguishing kin from non-kin. In vertebrates, the MHC contains genes that influence disease resistance and kin recognition and may be under intense balancing selection in some populations. Hence, genetic variation at the MHC might persist despite the extreme monomorphism shown by neutral markers. We examine variation of five loci within the MHC of San Nicolas Island foxes and find remarkably high levels of variation. Further, we show by simulation that genetic monomorphism at neutral loci and high MHC variation could arise only through an extreme population bottleneck of {\textless}10 individuals, approximately 10-20 generations ago, accompanied by unprecedented selection coefficients of {\textgreater}0.5 on MHC loci. These results support the importance of balancing selection as a mechanism to maintain variation in natural populations and expose the difficulty of using neutral markers as surrogates for variation in fitness-related loci.},

abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are highly abundant markers, which are broadly distributed in animal genomes. For rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), SNP discovery has been previously done through sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) libraries, reduced representation libraries (RRL) and RNA sequencing. Recently we have performed high coverage whole genome resequencing with 61 unrelated samples, representing a wide range of rainbow trout and steelhead populations, with 49 new samples added to 12 aquaculture samples from AquaGen (Norway) that we previously used for SNP discovery. Of the 49 new samples, 11 were double-haploid lines from Washington State University and 38 represented wild and hatchery populations from a wide range of geographic distribution and with divergent migratory phenotypes. We then mapped the sequences to the new rainbow trout reference genome assembly (GCA{\_}002163495.1) which is based on the Swanson YY doubled haploid line. Variant calling was conducted with FreeBayes and SAMtools mpileup, followed by filtering of SNPs based on quality score, sequence complexity, read depth on the locus, and number of genotyped samples. Results from the two variant calling programs were compared and genotypes of the double haploid samples were used for detecting and filtering putative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) and multi-sequence variants (MSVs). Overall, 30,302,087 SNPs were identified on the rainbow trout genome 29 chromosomes and 1,139,018 on unplaced scaffolds, with 4,042,723 SNPs having high minor allele frequency (MAF {\textgreater} 0.25). The average SNP density on the chromosomes was one SNP per 64 bp, or 15.6 SNPs per 1 kb. Results from the phylogenetic analysis that we conducted indicate that the SNP markers contain enough population-specific polymorphisms for recovering population relationships despite the small sample size used. Intra-Population polymorphism assessment revealed high level of polymorphism and heterozygosity within each population. We also provide functional annotation based on the genome position of each SNP and evaluate the use of clonal lines for filtering of PSVs and MSVs. These SNPs form a new database, which provides an important resource for a new high density SNP array design and for other SNP genotyping platforms used for genetic and genomics studies of this iconic salmonid fish species.},

First, population genetic models indicate that genetic variation and potential response to se- lection should be positively correlated with population size. The empirical support for this prediction is mixed:DNAmarkers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small populations, whereas quantita- tive traits show reduced heritability only in the smallest and most inbred populations. Quantitative variation can even increase in bot- tlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and ge- netic problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction probability of populations in changing environments. This second reason has not been included in assessments of crit- ical population size assuring evolvability and makes it likely that many small threatened populations have a decreased potential for adaptation.},

However, this problem can be overcome if genomic evaluation is used. Within-family genomic evaluation has been proposed for these programmes as large family sizes are available and substantial levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within families can be attained with a limited number of markers even in populations in global linkage equilibrium. Here, we compare by computer simulation: (i) within-family and population-wide LD; and (ii) the accuracy of within-family genomic selection when genomic evaluations are carried out either at the population level or within families. The population simulated was composed by a varying number of families of full-sibs (half for training and half for testing). The results indicate that, to practice within-family selection, performing the genomic evaluation separately for each family using only molecular information from the family could be recommended for populations either in linkage equilibrium or with a low level of disequilibrium.},

abstract = {The pace of climate change in the Arctic is dramatic, with temperatures rising at a rate double the global average. The timing of flowering and fruiting (phenology) is often temperature dependent and tends to advance as the climate warms. Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations can provide historical phenology records and have been used, on a localised scale, to predict species' phenological sensitivity to climate change. Conducting similar localised studies in the Canadian Arctic, however, poses a challenge where the collection of herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have been temporally and spatially sporadic. We used flowering and seed dispersal times of 23 Arctic species from herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across the 2.1million km(2) area of Nunavut, Canada, to determine (1) which monthly temperatures influence flowering and seed dispersal times; (2) species' phenological sensitivity to temperature; and (3) whether flowering or seed dispersal times have advanced over the past 120years. We tested this at different spatial scales and compared the sensitivity in different regions of Nunavut. Broadly speaking, this research serves as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology-climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales. Flowering times and seed dispersal time were most strongly correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively. Seed dispersal times have advanced at double the rate of flowering times over the past 120years, reflecting greater late-summer temperature rises in Nunavut. There is great diversity in the flowering time sensitivity to temperature of Arctic plant species, suggesting climate change implications for Arctic ecological communities, including altered community composition, competition, and pollinator interactions. Intraspecific temperature sensitivity and warming trends varied markedly across Nunavut and could result in greater changes in some parts of Nunavut than in others.},

Seed dispersal times have advanced at double rate of flowering times over the past 120 years.

Probably because July is warming more and across a greater area.

Flowering time sensitivity and seed dispersal sensitivity varied between species and between sites within species.

Climate change in Arctic is predominantly in late summer, autumn and winter. Important to study several life history stages, because responsiveness may vary between them.

abstract = {Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

A suite of studies from the past decade highlights the value of genetic rescue in increasing population fitness. Nonetheless, genetic rescue has not been widely applied to conserve many of the threatened populations that it could benefit. In this review, we highlight recent studies of genetic rescue and place it in the larger context of theoretical and empirical developments in evolutionary and conservation biology. We also propose directions to help shape future research on genetic rescue. Genetic rescue is a tool that can stem biodiversity loss more than has been appreciated, provides population resilience, and will become increasingly useful if integrated with molecular advances in population genomics.},

abstract = {One of the oldest hypotheses for the advantage of recombination is that recombination allows beneficial mutations that arise in different individuals to be placed together on the same chromosome. Unless recombination occurs, one of the beneficial alleles is doomed to extinction, slowing the rate at which adaptive mutations are incorporated within a population. We model the effects of a modifier of recombination on the fixation probability of beneficial mutations when beneficial alleles are segregating at other loci. We find that modifier alleles that increase recombination do increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutants and subsequently hitchhike along as the mutants rise in frequency. The strength of selection favoring a modifier that increases recombination is proportional to lambda(2)S delta r/r when linkage is tight and lambda(2)S3 delta r/N when linkage is loose, where lambda is the beneficial mutation rate per genome per generation throughout a population of size N, S is the average mutant effect, r is the average recombination rate, and delta r is the amount that recombination is modified. We conclude that selection for recombination will be substantial only if there is tight linkage within the genome or if many loci are subject to directional selection as during periods of rapid evolutionary change.},

MU status should only be assigned when the observed estimate of genetic divergence is significantly greater than a predefined threshold value.

abstract = {Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular signature of most viruses, and triggers inflammatory responses that prevent viral spread. TLR3 ectodomains (ECDs) dimerize on oligonucleotides of at least 40 to 50 base pairs in length, the minimal length required for signal transduction. To establish the molecular basis for ligand binding and signaling, we determined the crystal structure of a complex between two mouse TLR3-ECDs and dsRNA at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Each TLR3-ECD binds dsRNA at two sites located at opposite ends of the TLR3 horseshoe, and an intermolecular contact between the two TLR3-ECD C-terminal domains coordinates and stabilizes the dimer. This juxtaposition could mediate downstream signaling by dimerizing the cytoplasmic Toll interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The overall shape of the TLR3-ECD does not change upon binding to dsRNA.},

abstract = {A 30-year-old male presented to the office with multiple vague complaints including dizziness and vomiting (non-bloody, non-bilious) for three months. The patient had a multiply positive review of systems including generalized weakness and fatigue, an episode of loss of consciousness, intermittent blurry vision, as well as shortness of breath and chest tightness both at rest and with exertion. Other symptoms included night sweats, abdominal pain that did not change with food intake, daily headaches, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and short-term memory impairment. The patient denied weight loss, and no focal neurological changes. He presented in the spring and noted that all these symptoms had persisted for several months. His complaints were worse at night and in the morning and improved when the patient was away from his home. The patient had no prior medical problems and denied smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. The patient denied any environmental exposures at work, but noted that his carbon monoxide detector at his home would occasionally alarm. Further review of the patient's medical history revealed that during the first month of his symptoms, the patient had a syncope episode while working on a ladder at his job. The event was witnessed by colleagues and was described as lasting only a few seconds. Seizure activity was not observed. Because of the fall from the ladder and possible resulting head trauma, the patient was acutely evaluated at a local emergency department. He was discharged from the ER with the diagnosis of a post-concussion syndrome after a normal head and cervical spine CT. Following discharge from the ER, because of the persistence of symptoms, the patient was re-evaluated at an urgent care office and by an ophthalmologist. He was treated with tramadol, lorazepam, and metoclopramide and told his symptoms were likely secondary to a combination of his concussion and anxiety. Our examination revealed a fit-looking young man and was fairly unremarkable. Vital signs were within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure of 155/99. An arterial blood gas was remarkable for a low pO2 of 84 mmHg (reference range 98-118 mmHg) and a mildly elevated CO2 of 30 (reference range 20-29) on his basic electrolyte panel. His carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels on the arterial blood gas w/ co-oximetry were within normal limits. Additionally, labs including liver function tests, creatinine, and glucose were within normal limits. Given the patient's history of the chronic vague, non-specific symptoms, subtle lab findings, and reports of his CO detector alarming, there were concerns for chronic mild carbon monoxide exposure. The patient was advised to have his apartment inspected for CO levels and to remove himself from the likely source of carbon monoxide: his apartment. After being physically removed from his apartment for approximately seventy-two hours, his symptoms had significantly improved, but he still noted difficulty with concentration. The patient's apartment wall heater was replaced after it was determining to be leaking mildly elevated levels of carbon monoxide. Discussion Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly lighter than air. It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, although it is also produced in low quantities with normal animal metabolism and is thought to have some normal biological functions. For example, in the atmosphere, it is has a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. 1 Unintentional, non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the United States. It results in more than 20,000 emergency room visits annually. 2 It is most common during the winter months especially in cold climates. Smoke inhalation contributes to a majority of cases of CO poisoning. Other potential sources of CO include heating systems, fuel burning devices, and motor vehicles. Carbon monoxide is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations. It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which displaces the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen and makes hemoglobin ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Although acute CO poisoning is well-documented, chronic CO poisoning is less understood. 3,4 The most common symptoms of chronic carbon monoxide poisoning are vague. They include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a feeling of weakness. 3 Due to these non-specific symptoms, chronic carbon monoxide exposure is often misdiagnosed as a flu-like},

abstract = {The Arctic is experiencing some of the fastest rates of warming on the planet. Although many studies have documented responses to such warming by individual species, the idiosyncratic nature of these findings has prevented us from extrapolating them to community-level predictions. Here, we leverage the availability of a long-term dataset from Zackenberg, Greenland (593 700 specimens collected between 1996 and 2014), to investigate how climate parameters influence the abundance of different arthropod groups and overall community composition. We find that variation in mean seasonal temperatures, winter duration and winter freeze–thaw events is correlated with taxon-specific and habitat-dependent changes in arthropod abundances. In addition, we find that arthropod communities have exhibited compositional changes consistent with the expected effects of recent shifts towards warmer active seasons and fewer freeze–thaw events in NE Greenland. Changes in community composition are up to five times more extreme in drier than wet habitats, with herbivores and parasitoids generally increasing in abundance, while the opposite is true for surface detritivores. These results suggest that species interactions and food web dynamics are changing in the Arctic, with potential implications for key ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling and primary productivity.},

abstract = {The success of an aquaculture breeding program critically depends on the way in which the base population of breeders is constructed since all the genetic variability for the traits included originally in the breeding goal as well as those to be included in the future is contained in the initial founders. Traditionally, base populations were created from a number of wild strains by sampling equal numbers from each strain. However, for some aquaculture species improved strains are already available and, therefore, mean phenotypic values for economically important traits can be used as a criterion to optimize the sampling when creating base populations. Also, the increasing availability of genome-wide genotype information in aquaculture species could help to refine the estimation of relationships within and between candidate strains and, thus, to optimize the percentage of individuals to be sampled from each strain. This study explores the advantages of using phenotypic and genome-wide information when constructing base populations for aquaculture breeding programs in terms of initial and subsequent trait performance and genetic diversity level. Results show that a compromise solution between diversity and performance can be found when creating base populations. Up to 6{\%} higher levels of phenotypic performance can be achieved at the same level of global diversity in the base population by optimizing the selection of breeders instead of sampling equal numbers from each strain. The higher performance observed in the base population persisted during 10 generations of phenotypic selection applied in the subsequent breeding program.},

abstract = {We sequenced 2800 bp of mitochondrial DNA from each of 33 species and 2 subspecies (35 taxa) of terns (Sternini), and employed Bayesian methods to derive a phylogeny with good branch support based on posterior probabilities. The resulting tree confirmed many of the generally accepted taxonomic groups, and led us to suggest a revision of the terns that recognizes 12 genera, 11 of which correspond to a distinct clade on the tree or a highly divergent species (1 genus was not represented in the phylogeny). As an example of how the molecular phylogeny reflects similarities in morphology and behavior among the terns, we used the phylogeny to examine the evolution of the breeding (alternate) head plumage patterns among the terns to test the hypothesis that this character is phylogenetically informative. The three basic types of head plumage (white crown, black cap, and black cap with a white blaze on the forehead) were highly conserved within clades, with notable exceptions in two white-crowned species that evolved independently among the black-capped terns. Based on the appearance of the close relatives of these exceptional species, their white crowns appear to be due to the retention of either winter (basic) plumage characteristics or perhaps juvenile characteristics when the birds molt into their breeding plumage. Examination of the evolutionary history of head plumage indicated that the white-crowned species such as the noddies (Anous) and the white tern (Gygis alba) are probably most representative of ancestral terns. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {An image can encode date, time, location and camera information as metadata and implicitly encodes species information and data on human activity, for example the size distribution of fish removals. Accurate length estimates can be made from images using a fiducial marker; however, their manual extraction is time-consuming and estimates are inaccurate without control over the imaging system. This article presents a methodology which uses machine vision to estimate the total length (TL) of a fusiform fish (European sea bass). Three regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) were trained from public images. Images of European sea bass were captured with a fiducial marker with three non-specialist cameras. Images were undistorted using the intrinsic lens properties calculated for the camera in OpenCV; then TL was estimated using machine vision (MV) to detect both marker and subject. MV performance was evaluated for the three R-CNNs under downsampling and rotation of the captured images. Each R-CNN accurately predicted the location of fish in test images (mean intersection over union, 93{\%}) and estimates of TL were accurate, with percent mean bias error ({\%}MBE [95{\%} CIs]) = 2.2{\%} [2.0, 2.4]). Detections were robust to horizontal flipping and downsampling. TL estimates at absolute image rotations {\textgreater}20° became increasingly inaccurate but {\%}MBE [95{\%} CIs] was reduced to −0.1{\%} [−0.2, 0.1] using machine learning to remove outliers and model bias. Machine vision can classify and derive measurements of species from images without specialist equipment. It is anticipated that ecological researchers and managers will make increasing use of MV where image data are collected (e.g. in remote electronic monitoring, virtual observations, wildlife surveys and morphometrics) and MV will be of particular utility where large volumes of image data are gathered.},

abstract = {Island populations are much more prone to extinction than mainland populations. The reasons for this remain controversial. If inbreeding and loss of genetic variation are involved, then genetic variation must be lower on average in island than mainland populations. Published data on levels of genetic variation for allozymes, nuclear DNA markers, mitochondrial DNA, inversions and quantitative characters in island and mainland populations were analysed. A large and highly significant majority of island populations have less allozyme genetic variation than their mainland counterparts (165 of 202 comparisons), the average reduction being 29 per cent. The magnitude of differences was related to dispersal ability. There were related differences for all the other measures. Island endemic species showed lower genetic variation than related mainland species in 34 of 38 cases. The proportionate reduction in genetic variation was significantly greater in island endemic than in nonendemic island populations in mammals and birds, but not in insects. Genetic factors cannot be discounted as a cause of higher extinction rates of island than mainland populations.},

abstract = {Genetic rescue, outcrossing with individuals from a related population, is used to augment genetic diversity in populations threatened by severe inbreeding and extinction. The endan-gered Norwegian Lundehund dog underwent at least two severe bottlenecks in the 1940s and 1960s that each left only five inbred dogs, and the approximately 1500 dogs remaining world-wide today appear to descend from only two individuals. The Lundehund has a high prevalence of a gastrointestinal disease, to which all remaining dogs may be predisposed. Outcrossing is currently performed with three Nordic Spitz breeds: Norwegian Buhund, Ice-landic Sheepdog, and Norrbottenspets. Examination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes based on 165K loci in 48 dogs from the four breeds revealed substantially lower genetic diversity for the Lundehund (H E 0.035) than for other breeds (H E 0.209– 0.284). Analyses of genetic structure with {\textgreater} 15K linkage disequilibrium-pruned SNPs showed four distinct genetic clusters. Pairwise F ST values between Lundehund and the can-didate breeds were highest for Icelandic Sheepdog, followed by Buhund and Norrbotten-spets. We assessed the presence of outlier loci among candidate breeds and examined flanking genome regions (1 megabase) for genes under possible selection to identify poten-tial adaptive differences among breeds; outliers were observed in flanking regions of genes associated with key functions including the immune system, metabolism, cognition and physical development. We suggest crossbreeding with multiple breeds as the best strategy to increase genetic diversity for the Lundehund and to reduce the incidence of health prob-lems. For this project, the three candidate breeds were first selected based on phenotypes and then subjected to genetic investigation. Because phenotypes are often paramount for},

abstract = {Because of the new molecular genetics information from various genome projects, new applications and insights for genetics studies in endangered species are forthcoming. Neutral variants are generally used for conservation applications and estimating evolutionary parameters, and with highly variable loci, many more markers, or extensive sequence data, these approaches should become much more informative. Detrimental and adaptive variation is of importance in conservation genetics but identification and characterization of such variation is more difficult. Neutral variants might be used to identify adaptive variants but the overlay of different mutational processes and selective regimes suggests that great caution should be used in making such predictions. Examples in endangered species discussed below are (1) estimation of long-term effective population size using neutral markers in three fishes of the lower Colorado River; (2) genetic restoration of the Florida panther by the introduction of Texas cougars; (3) impact of pathogens and adaptive variation on the winter-run chinook salmon; (4) examination of the adaptive variation for a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene in red wolves.

abstract = {A perceived consequence of a population bottleneck is the erosion of genetic diversity and concomitant reduction in individual fitness and evolutionary potential. Although reduced genetic variation associated with demographic perturbation has been amply demonstrated for neutral molecular markers, the effective management of genetic resources in natural populations is hindered by a lack of understanding of how adaptive genetic variation will respond to population fluctuations, given these are affected by selection as well as drift. Here, we demonstrate that selection counters drift to maintain polymorphism at a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus through a population bottleneck in an inbred island population of water voles. Before and after the bottleneck, MHC allele frequencies were close to balancing selection equilibrium but became skewed by drift when the population size was critically low. MHC heterozygosity generally conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations except in one generation during the population recovery where there was a significant excess of heterozygous genotypes, which simulations ascribed to strong differential MHC-dependent survival. Low allelic diversity and highly skewed frequency distributions at microsatellite loci indicated potent genetic drift due to a strong founder affect and/or previous population bottlenecks. This study is a real-time examination of the predictions of fundamental evolutionary theory in low genetic diversity situations. The findings highlight that conservation efforts to maintain the genetic health and evolutionary potential of natural populations should consider the genetic basis for fitness-related traits, and how such adaptive genetic diversity will vary in response to both the demographic fluctuations and the effects of selection.},

The SNP array is publically available from a commercial vendor (Affymetrix). The SNP genotyping quality was high, and validation rate was close to 90{\%}. This is comparable to other farm animals and is much higher than previous smaller scale SNP validation studies in rainbow trout. High quality and integrity of the genotypes are evident from sample reproducibility and from nearly 100{\%} agreement in genotyping results from other methods. The array is very useful for rainbow trout aquaculture populations with more than 40 900 polymorphic markers per population. For wild populations that were confounded by a smaller sample size, the number of polymorphic markers was between 10 577 and 24 330. Comparison between genotypes from individual populations suggests good potential for identifying candidate markers for populations' traceability.

abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes are frequently used as a model for adaptive genetic diversity. Although associations between Mhc and disease resistance are frequently documented, little is known about the fitness consequences of Mhc variation in wild populations. Further, most work to date has involved testing associations between Mhc genotypes and fitness components. However, the functional diversity of the Mhc, and hence the mechanism by which selection on Mhc acts, depends on how genotypes map to the functional properties of Mhc molecules. Here, we test three hypotheses that relate Mhc diversity to fitness: (i) the maximal diversity hypothesis, (ii) the optimal diversity hypothesis and (iii) effect of specific Mhc types. We combine mark-recapture methods with analysis of long-term breeding data to investigate the effects of Mhc class I functional diversity (Mhc supertypes) on individual fitness in a wild great tit (Parus major) population. We found that the presence of three different Mhc supertypes was associated with three different components of individual fitness: survival, annual recruitment and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). Great tits possessing Mhc supertype 3 experienced higher survival rates than those that did not, whereas individuals with Mhc supertype 6 experienced higher LRS and were more likely to recruit offspring each year. Conversely, great tits that possessed Mhc supertype 5 had reduced LRS. We found no evidence for a selective advantage of Mhc diversity, in terms of either maximal or optimal supertype diversity. Our results support the suggestion that specific Mhc types are an important determinant of individual fitness.},

We measured habitat loss individually within the known ranges of 243 terrestrial species at risk of extinction across Canada. Recovery potential, as measured by extent of natural habitat within each species{\~{O}} range, is bimodally distributed, but less than 50{\%} of the range of the majority of Canada's species at risk is natural habitat and there is no detectable habitat remaining for 16 of the 243 species at risk.

Despite having extensive wilderness areas, Canada has similar rates of endangerment to other countries in the Americas, underlining the effect of severe habitat loss to intensive agriculture that has occurred in Canada's most biologically diverse regions.

The disease mainly affected the heart and resembled heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). HSMI is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and a search for a similar virus in the diseased rainbow trout led to detection of a sequence with 85{\%} similarity to PRV. This finding called for a targeted effort to assess the risk the new PRV-variant pose on farmed rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon by studying infection and disease pathogenesis, aiming to provide more diagnostic knowledge. Based on the genetic relationship to PRV, the novel virus is referred to as PRV-Oncorhynchus mykiss (PRV-Om) in contrast to PRV-Salmo salar (PRV-Ss). In experimental trials, intraperitoneally injected PRV-Om was shown to replicate in blood in both salmonid species, but more effectively in rainbow trout. In rainbow trout, the virus levels peaked in blood and heart of cohabitants 6 weeks post challenge, along with increased expression of antiviral genes (Mx and viperin) in the spleen, with 80–100{\%} of the cohabitants infected. Heart inflammation was diagnosed in all cohabitants examined 8 weeks post challenge. In contrast, less than 50{\%} of the Atlantic salmon cohabitants were infected between 8 and 16 weeks post challenge and the antiviral response in these fish was very low. From 12 weeks post challenge and onwards, mild focal myocarditis was demonstrated in a few virus-positive salmon. In conclusion, PRV-Om infects both salmonid species, but faster transmission, more notable antiviral response and more prominent heart pathology were observed in rainbow trout.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported associations between heterozygosity in microsatellite markers and fitness-related traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations, HFCs). However, it has often been questioned whether HFCs reflect general inbreeding depression, because a small panel of microsatellite markers does not reflect very well an individual's inbreeding coefficient (F) as calculated from a pedigree. Here, we challenge this prevailing view. Because of chance events during Mendelian segregation, an individual's realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBD) may substantially deviate from the pedigree-based expectation (i.e. F). This Mendelian noise may result in a weak correlation between F and multi-locus heterozygosity, but this does not imply that multi-locus heterozygosity is a bad estimator of realized IBD. We examined correlations between 11 fitness-related traits measured in up to 1192 captive zebra finches and three measures of inbreeding: (i) heterozygosity across 11 microsatellite markers, (ii) heterozygosity across 1359 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and (iii) F, based on a 5th-generation pedigree. All 11 phenotypic traits showed positive relationships with measures of heterozygosity, especially traits that are most closely related to fitness. Remarkably, the small panel of microsatellite markers produced equally strong HFCs as the large panel of SNP markers. Both marker-based approaches produced stronger correlations with phenotypes than the pedigree-based F, and this did not seem to result from the shortness of our pedigree. We argue that a small panel of microsatellites with high allelic richness may better reflect an individual's realized IBD than previously appreciated, especially in species like the zebra finch, where much of the genome is inherited in large blocks that rarely experience cross-over during meiosis.},

abstract = {Although F(ST) is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F'(ST) and D. F'(ST) is the normal F(ST) standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (F(ST), F'(ST) and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4 years of Molecular Ecology. As with F(ST), unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F'(ST). Here, we develop a new unbiased F'(ST) estimator based on G(ST), which we call G''(ST). However, F'(ST) can be calculated using any F(ST) estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of F(ST) in combination with either F'(ST) or D. In most cases, F'(ST) would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

Abstract: Genetic diversity is one of three levels of biological diversity requiring conservation. Genetic theory predicts that levels of genetic variation should increase with effective population size. Soule (1976) compiled the first convincing evidence that levels of genetic variation in wildlife were related to population size, but this issue remains controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related to population size leads to the following predictions: (1) genetic variation within species should be related to population size; (2) genetic variation within species should be related to island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to population size within taxonomic groups; (4) widespread species should have more genetic variation than restricted spe-cies; (5) genetic variation in animals should be negatively correlated with body size; (6) genetic variation should be negatively correlated with rate of chromosome evolution; (7) genetic variation across species should be related to population size; (8) vertebrates should have less genetic variation than invertebrates or plants; (9) island populations should have less genetic variation than mainland populations; and (10) en-dangered species should have less genetic variation than nonendangered species. Empirical observations sup-port all these hypotheses. There can be no doubt that genetic variation is related to population size, as Soule proposed. Smallpopulation size reduces the evolutionary potential of wildlife species.

Soule (1976) reuni6 la primera evidencia convincente de que los niveles de variaci6n gen6tica en lafauna silvestre se relacionaban con el tamafio de suspoblaciones. Sin embargo, este tema sigue siendo controversial. La hip6tesis de que la variaci6n gen6tica se relaciona con el tamaio poblacional con-duce a las siguientes predicciones (1) la variaci6n gene'tica intraespec{\{}fica debe relacionarse con el tamanio de la poblaci6n, (2) la variaci6n gen6tica intraespecifica debe relacionarse con el tamafio de la isle, (3) la variaci6n gene'tica debe relacionarse con el tamafio poblacional dentro de grupos taxon6micos, (4) especies ampliamente distribuidas deben tener mayor variaci6n gene'tica que especies de distribuci6n restringida, (5) la variaci6n gen6tica en animales debe tener una correlaci6n negative con el tamafTo del cuerpo, (6) la vari-aci6n gene'tica debe correlacionarse negativamente con la tasa de evoluci6n cromos6mica, (7) la variaci6n gene'tica intraespecifica debe relacionarse con el tamaflo de la poblaci6n, (8) los vertebrados deben tener menos variaci6n gene'tica que los invertebrados o plantas, (9) poblaciones insulares deben tener menos vari-aci6n gene'tica que poblaciones continentales, (10) especies amenazadas deben tener menos variaci6n gene'tica que especies no amenazadas.

abstract = {In order to protect the body from infectious microorganisms, mammals have developed powerful lines of defense, consisting in innate and adaptive immune responses. The innate response is phylogenetically more ancient and, for a long time, it has been considered to be broadly directed to microorganisms. However, the discovery of a new class of receptors, involved in recognition of patterns characteristic of groups of microorganisms (the toll-like receptor family) has re-evaluated the role of the innate immune system as a discriminating system. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that the induction of different types of effector adaptive responses are directed by the innate immune system after recognition of particular groups of pathogens. The central role of Dendritic cells (DC) in the induction of adaptive immune responses towards infectious agents has been extensively described, but, recently, a new role of DC as a link between the non-antigen- and the antigen-specific responses has been proposed. DC have, indeed, the capacity to recruit and activate cells of the innate immune system upon inflammation. Thus. understanding the interaction of bacteria with DC, and the early molecular events resulting from this interaction may shed some light on the mechanisms of initiation of the immune response to infectious agents and on aspects of invasiveness, pathogenicity, and the persistence of certain bacteria.},

abstract = {Author SummaryIdentifying regions of protein coding genes that have undergone adaptive evolution is important to answering many questions in evolutionary biology and genetics. In order to tease out genetic evidence for natural selection, genes from a diverse array of taxa must be analyzed, only a subset of which may have undergone adaptive evolution; the same gene region may be under stabilizing or relaxed selection in lineages leading to other taxa. Most current computational methods designed to detect the imprint of natural selection at a site in a protein coding gene assume the strength and direction of natural selection is constant across all lineages. Here, we present a method to detect adaptive evolution, even when the selective forces are not constant across taxa. Using a variety of well-characterized genes, we find evidence suggesting that natural selection is generally episodic and that modeling it as such reveals that many more sites are subject to episodic positive selection than previously appreciated.},

Yet recent evidence indicates that the evolution of these genes is strongly shaped by the biophysical processes of protein synthesis, protein folding, and specific as well as nonspecific protein-protein interactions. Selection pressures related to these biophysical processes affect primarily the amino-acid sequence of genes, but they also leave their mark on synonymous sites at the nucleotide level. While evidence for specific selection pressures related to protein biophysics is strong, there is currently no unifying framework that integrates the various selection pressures on coding sequences and disentangles their relative importance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Maintaining genetic diversity is a crucial goal of intensive management of threatened species, particularly for those populations that act as sources for translocation or reintroduction programmes. Most captive genetic management is based on pedigrees and a neutral theory of inheritance, an assumption that may be violated by selective forces operating in captivity. In this paper, we explore the conservation consequences of early viability selection: differential offspring survival that occurs prior to management or research observations, such as embryo deaths in utero. If early viability selection produces genotypic deviations from Mendelian predictions, it may undermine management strategies intended to minimise inbreeding and maintain genetic diversity. We use empirical examples to demonstrate that straightforward approaches, such as comparing litter sizes of inbred versus non-inbred breeding pairs, can be used to test whether early viability selection likely impacts estimates of inbreeding depression. We also show that comparing multilocus genotype data to pedigree predictions can reveal whether early viability selection drives systematic biases in genetic diversity, patterns that would not be detected using pedigree-based statistics alone. More sophisticated analysis combining genome-wide molecular data with pedigree information will enable conservation scientists to test whether early viability selection drives deviations from neutrality across wide stretches of the genome, revealing whether this form of selection biases the pedigree-based statistics and inference upon which intensive management is based.

abstract = {The organization of ecological communities along local environmental gradients provides important information about how such communities may respond to environmental change. In the Arctic, the importance of gradients in shrub cover and soil moisture for non-marine arthropod communities has been clearly demonstrated. By replicating studies along shrub and moisture gradients at multiple elevations and using space-for-time substitution, it is possible to examine how arthropod communities may respond to future environmental change. We collected and identified 4640 adult specimens of spiders and beetles near Narsarsuaq, South Greenland between 8 July and 25 August, 2014 from 112 pitfall traps. The traps were arranged in eight plots covering local gradients in either soil moisture or tall shrub dominance at both low and high elevation. Multivariate generalized linear models revealed that community composition was significantly related to shrub height and soil moisture, and that this relationship varied between low and high elevation. Among the 46 species we found, more species were unique to the high elevation plots than to the low elevation plots, a finding that was most pronounced for spiders in plots along soil moisture gradients. Indicator species analysis corroborated earlier findings of the indicator value of specific species in Greenland and suggested that beetles may serve as better indicators of specific habitats than spiders. The location of plots along local environmental gradients allowed us to detect fine-scale variation in arthropod communities. Together, our results suggest that Arctic arthropod community responses to environmental change may differ among low and high elevation sites.},

abstract = {Vegetation maps are models of the real vegetation patterns and are considered important tools in conservation and management planning. Maps created through traditional methods can be expensive and time‐consuming, thus, new more efficient approaches are needed. The prediction of vegetation patterns using machine learning shows promise, but many factors may impact on its performance. One important factor is the nature of the vegetation–environment relationship assessed and ecological redundancy. We used two datasets with known ecological redundancy levels (strength of the vegetation–environment relationship) to evaluate the performance of four machine learning (ML) classifiers (classification trees, random forests, support vector machines, and nearest neighbor). These models used climatic and soil variables as environmental predictors with pretreatment of the datasets (principal component analysis and feature selection) and involved three spatial scales. We show that the ML classifiers produced more reliable results in regions where the vegetation–environment relationship is stronger as opposed to regions characterized by redundant vegetation patterns. The pretreatment of datasets and reduction in prediction scale had a substantial influence on the predictive performance of the classifiers. The use of ML classifiers to create potential vegetation maps shows promise as a more efficient way of vegetation modeling. The difference in performance between areas with poorly versus well‐structured vegetation–environment relationships shows that some level of understanding of the ecology of the target region is required prior to their application. Even in areas with poorly structured vegetation–environment relationships, it is possible to improve classifier performance by either pretreating the dataset or reducing the spatial scale of the predictions.},
annote = {ML algorithm identifies trends in a sample dataset and produces a model. The model is then used to predict on an unseen dataset. 
ML model for vegetation mapping should produce a model that represent the relationship between vegetation types and environmental variables (climate, geology). 
The performance of the model depends on data quality and scale of classification. 
But since the model is a function of the relationship between vegetation and environment, the details of this relationship will also impact classification. 
{\textperiodcentered}         Whether a species is present in an area is determined by its life-history traits and the abiotic and biotic environment. 
{\textperiodcentered}         Niche theory: a given species has a unique position along environmental gradient. 
{\textperiodcentered}         But some vegetation types have many species with similar functional roles within the plant community. The functional role of these species are redundant. 
{\textperiodcentered}         Communities that differ in species composition may exist along similar environmental gradients. 
{\textperiodcentered}         In redundant systems: Many plant communities can be found, but the relationship between communities and environmental factors is unclear. 
{\textperiodcentered}         In low redundancy systems, a stronger link between community and environment exists. 
The study investigated the impact of the vegetation-environment relationship on the performance of ML classifiers. 
Predicted vegetation in 
1)      eucalypt-dominated tropical savannah woodlands: low redundancy 
2)      temperate kwongan shrubland: Very diverse and high redundancy 
Had data on plant communities for both areas. 20 in 1, 17 in 2. 
67 climatic variables and 12 terrain-based layers. 23 soil sample variables from Kwongan. But interpolations from database for woodland. 
  
Woodland vegetation patterns well explained by environmental variables. Kwongan was not. Study suggests this is because of ecological redundancy. 
Study concludes that vegetation patterns can be predicted with better confidence in areas with low redundancy. 
Point: We need an ecological understanding of a target area before applying ML.},

Here we present the crystal structures of the human TLR1-TLR2-lipopeptide complex and of the mouse TLR2-lipopeptide complex. Binding of the tri-acylated lipopeptide, Pam(3)CSK(4), induced the formation of an "m" shaped heterodimer of the TLR1 and TLR2 ectodomains whereas binding of the di-acylated lipopeptide, Pam(2)CSK(4), did not. The three lipid chains of Pam(3)CSK(4) mediate the heterodimerization of the receptor; the two ester-bound lipid chains are inserted into a pocket in TLR2, while the amide-bound lipid chain is inserted into a hydrophobic channel in TLR1. An extensive hydrogen-bonding network, as well as hydrophobic interactions, between TLR1 and TLR2 further stabilize the heterodimer. We propose that formation of the TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer brings the intracellular TIR domains close to each other to promote dimerization and initiate signaling.},

Our goal was to determine whether these genes show sufficient genetic diversity in a bottlenecked population to be a useful addition or alternative to the more commonly employed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotyping in a conservation genetics context. We amplified all known avian TLR genes in a severely bottlenecked population of New Zealand's Stewart Island robin (Petroica australis rakiura), for which reduced microsatellite diversity was previously observed. We genotyped 17-24 birds from a reintroduced island population (including the 12 founders) for nine genes, seven of which were polymorphic. We observed a total of 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms overall, 15 of which were non-synonymous, representing up to five amino-acid variants at a locus. One locus (TLR1LB) showed evidence of past directional selection. Results also confirmed a passerine duplication of TLR7. The levels of TLR diversity that we observe are sufficient to justify their further use in addressing conservation genetic questions, even in bottlenecked populations.},

abstract = {Terrestrial arthropods comprise the most species-rich communities on Earth, and grassland flowers provide resources for hundreds of thousands of arthropod species. Diverse grassland ecosystems worldwide are threatened by various types of environmental change, which has led to decline in arthropod diversity. At the same time, monitoring grassland arthropod diversity is time-consuming and strictly dependent on declining taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of complex samples has demonstrated that information on species compositions can be efficiently and non-invasively obtained. Here, we test the potential of wild flowers as a novel source of arthropod eDNA. We performed eDNA metabarcoding of flowers from several different plant species using two sets of generic primers, targeting the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI. Our results show that terrestrial arthropod species leave traces of DNA on the flowers that they interact with. We obtained eDNA from at least 135 arthropod species in 67 families and 14 orders, together representing diverse ecological groups including pollinators, parasitoids, gall induc-ers, predators, and phytophagous species. Arthropod communities clustered together according to plant species. Our data also indicate that this experiment was not exhaustive, and that an even higher arthropod richness could be obtained using this eDNA approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain information on diverse communities of insects and other terrestrial arthropods from eDNA metabarcoding of wild flowers. This novel source of eDNA represents a vast potential for addressing fundamental research questions in ecology, obtaining data on cryptic and unknown species of plant-associated arthropods, as well as applied research on pest management or conservation of endangered species such as wild pollinators.

abstract = {1. Rapid warming has facilitated an increase in deciduous shrub cover in arctic tundra. Because shrubs create a cooler microclimate during the growing season, shrub cover could modulate the effects of global warming on the phenology and activity of ectotherms, including arthropods. This possibility was explored here using two dominant arthropod groups (flies and wolf spiders) in Alaskan tundra. 2. We monitored arthropods with pitfall traps over five summers at four sites that differed in shrub abundance, and used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to separate the two underlying components of pitfall trap catch: the seasonal trend in arthropod density and the effects of short-term weather variation (air temperature, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation) on arthropod activity. 3. We found that shrub cover significantly altered the seasonal trend in the abundance of flies by reducing early-season pitfall catch, in line with observed later snowmelt in shrub-dominated plots at these sites. 4. Additionally, shrub cover modulated the effects of many weather variables on arthropod activity: shrub cover shifted wolf spiders' temperature–activity relationship, dampened the positive effect of solar radiation on the activity of arthropods in total, and ameliorated the negative effect of wind on the activity of flies. 5. Thus, these results indicate that shrub encroachment will probably be accompanied by altered arthropod responses to warming and other key weather variables. Because the rate of key ecological processes – herbivory, decomposition, predation – are controlled by activity at the organismal level, these effects on arthropods will have long-term ecosystem-level consequences.},

abstract = {Invading pathogens are controlled by the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Adaptive immunity, which is mediated by B and T lymphocytes, recognises pathogens by rearranged high affinity receptors. However, the establishment of adaptive immunity is often not rapid enough to eradicate microorganisms as it involves cell proliferation, gene activation and protein synthesis. More rapid defense mechanisms are provided by innate immunity, which recognises invading pathogens by germ-line-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Recent evidence shows that this recognition can mainly be attributed to the family of TOLL-like receptors (TLR). Binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) to TLR induces the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and up-regulates expression of co-stimulatory molecules, subsequently initiating the adaptive immunity. In this review, we will summarize the discovery and the critical roles of the TLR family in host defense, briefly allude to signaling mechanisms mediating the response to TLR ligands, and will provide an update on current knowledge regarding the ligand specificity of these receptors and their role in immunity of domestic animals, particularly cattle.},

The protocol amplifies the exon coding for the peptide that interacts with invading pathogens and is applicable across a wide range of passerine bird species, although with varying success depending on species. In several species tested, we found individuals to be heterozygous at several of the genes, highlighting the existence of coding genetic variation in this part of the immune system. Furthermore, for several of the genes, alleles have been conserved at the amino acid level across taxonomically distant bird species. In one case, we observed the existence of trans-species polymorphisms, often taken as evidence of balancing selection. The method will make it possible to investigate a part of the immune system for which there exists very little information of the genetic variation in wild vertebrate populations, thus making it possible to start investigating the selective forces under which the genes are evolving and the extent to which the found genetic variation is associated with pathogen susceptibility in wild populations.},

To increase cost-efficiency, computer-based taxa identification for image data has recently been developed. Taxa identification errors can, however, have strong effects on the indices and thus on the determination of the ecological status. In order to shift the biomonitoring process towards automated expert systems, we need a clear understanding on the bias caused by automation. In this paper, we examine eleven classification methods in the case of macroinvertebrate image data and show how their classification errors propagate into different biological indices. We evaluate 14 richness, diversity, dominance and similarity indices commonly used in biomonitoring. Besides the error rate of the classification method, we discuss the potential effect of different types of identification errors. Finally, we provide recommendations on indices that are least affected by the automatic identification errors and could be used in automated biomonitoring.},

abstract = {Genetic studies have typically inferred the effects of human impact by documenting patterns of genetic differentiation and levels of genetic diversity among potentially isolated populations using selective neutral markers such as mitochondrial control region sequences, microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes within and between populations can only be reflected by coding genes. In vertebrates, growing evidence suggests that genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC variants influence many important biological traits, including immune recognition, susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, individual odours, mating preferences, kin recognition, cooperation and pregnancy outcome. These diverse functions and characteristics place genes of the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. MHC variability is believed to be maintained by pathogen-driven selection, mediated either through heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent selection. Up to now, most of our knowledge has derived from studies in humans or from model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions. Empirical support for selective mechanisms in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment is rare. In this review, I first introduce general information about the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of MHC variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on the evidence derived from free-ranging animal populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic variability with respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.},

abstract = {The role of biotic interactions in shaping plant flowering phenology has long been controversial; plastic responses to the abiotic environment, limited precision of biological clocks and inconsistency of selection pressures have generally been emphasized to explain phenological variation. However, part of this variation is heritable and selection analyses show that biotic interactions can modulate selection on flowering phenology. Our review of the literature indicates that pollinators tend to favour peak or earlier flowering, whereas pre-dispersal seed predators tend to favour off-peak or later flowering. However, effects strongly vary among study systems. To understand such variation, future studies should address the impact of mutualist and antagonist dispersal ability, ecological specialization, and habitat and plant population characteristics. Here, we outline future directions to study how such interactions shape flowering phenology.}

abstract = {Abstract Measures of the seasonal timing of biological events are key to addressing questions about how phenology evolves, modifies species interactions, and mediates biological responses to climate change. Phenology is often characterized in terms of discrete events, such as a date of first flowering or arrival of first migrants. We discuss how phenological events that are typically measured at the population or species level arise from distributions of phenological events across seasons, and from norms of reaction of these phenological events across environments. We argue that individual variation in phenological distributions and reaction norms has important implications for how we should collect, analyze, and interpret phenological information. Regarding phenology as a reaction norm rather than one year's specific values implies that selection acts on the phenologies that an individual expresses over its lifetime. To understand how climate change is likely to influence phenology, we need to consider not only plastic responses along the reaction norm but changes in the reaction norm itself. We show that when individuals vary in their reaction norms, correlations between reaction norm elevation and slope make first events particularly poor estimators of population sensitivity to climate change, and variation in slopes can obscure the pattern of selection on phenology. We also show that knowing the shape of the distribution of phenological events across the season is important for predicting biologically important phenological mismatches with climate change. Last, because phenological events are parts of a continuous developmental process, we suggest that the approach of measuring phenology by recording developmental stages of individuals in a population at a single point in time should be used more widely. We conclude that failure to account for phenological distributions and reaction norms may lead to overinterpretation of metrics based on single events, such as commonly recorded first event dates, and may confound meta-analyses that use a range of metrics. Rather than prescribing a single universal approach to studying phenology, we point out limitations of inferences based on single metrics and encourage work that considers the multivariate nature of phenology and more tightly links data collection and analyses with biological hypotheses.},

abstract = {Summary 1 First flowering dates are occurring earlier than they did in the past in many locations around the world. It is sometimes assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that the changes in first flowering dates describe the phenological behaviour of entire populations. However, first flowering dates represent one extreme of the flowering distribution and may be susceptible to undesirable confounding effects. 2 We used observations of flowering in Colorado and Massachusetts to test whether changes in population size and sampling frequency affect observations of first flowering dates. 3 We found that the effect of population size on first flowering dates depended on location. Changes in population size were strongly related to the dates on which first flowering was observed in Massachusetts but not in Colorado. The lack of a significant effect in Colorado may reflect the rapid onset of spring after snowmelt and fixed developmental schedules of the plants at this sub-alpine site, or the scale of the plots sampled during the study. 4 We also found that changes in sampling frequency can influence observed changes in first flowering dates and other aspects of the flowering distribution. Similar to the effect of declines in population size, lower sampling frequency caused later observations of first flowering. However, lower sampling frequency, if maintained consistently throughout a study, did not significantly affect estimates of changes in flowering dates over time or in response to climate. 5 Synthesis. Researchers should consider the effects of changes in population size and sampling frequency when interpreting changes in first flowering dates. In some cases, past results may need to be reinterpreted. When possible, researchers should observe the entire flowering distribution or consider tracking peak or mean flowering dates to avoid the confounding effects of population size and sampling frequency.},

 abstract = {1 Pollen limitation of female fertility has often been documented in animal-pollinated plants, but seldom have the ecological mechanisms responsible been investigated. We examined factors influencing pollen limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination. Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 3-4-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatiens) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.},

abstract = {An earlier study of the morphological variation in the circumpolar genus Dryas in Greenland revealed that populations in east Greenland are highly variable and this variation was interpreted as a hybrid zone between D. octopetala and D. integrifolia. It was proposed that populations of Dryas in east Greenland immigrated postglacially from Svalbard. The purpose of our study was to investigate the population structure of the Dryas integrifolia-octopetala complex using a combination of morphological and genetic characters. Populations of Dryas were sampled in Greenland, Svalbard, Iceland and north Scandinavia (Sweden). The morphological traits clearly separated west Greenland from Svalbard, Iceland and north Scandinavia. A large number of individuals from east Greenland and some from north Greenland could be interpreted as hybrids between the morphs. The genetic pattern was, however, partly different as the greatest amount of differentiation among regions was found between west and north Greenland (FRT = 0.65). The highest degree of genetic variation appeared within east Greenland. This was in accordance with the putative hybrid origin of the populations, as concluded based on the morphological results. The total amount of genetic differentiation found among the six regions (FRT = 0.61) was larger than between the two species (FRT = 0.44). The genetic pattern matched the proposed postglacial migration routes.},

abstract = {The close morphological and temporal links between phases of plant growth and reproduction call for integrated studies incorporating several reproductive phases from flowering to recruitment, and associated plant-animal interactions. Phenological strategies, as well as plastic phenological response to climate change, incorporate complex interactions between developmental constraints, pollination and seed dispersal. Relationships between reproductive phenology and components of fitness were studied for two years in the north-temperate, self-incompatible, insect-pollinated, and bird-dispersed shrub Frangula alnus (Rhamnaceae). Fruit set, dispersal, germination and juvenile survival, as well as seed mass and juvenile size were measured in relation to flowering, fruiting and germination time. The results suggest that effects of flowering and fruiting time prevailed in subsequent phases, to some extent as far as to the juvenile phase, but effects of timing were complex and had partly opposing effects on different fitness components. Early flowers had higher fruit-set and experiments indicated that synchronous peak flowering increased fruit-set, but later flowers had higher seed mass. Peak fruiting was not associated with peak dispersal. Late fruits derived from late flowers promoted dispersal. Juvenile recruitment was enhanced by increasing seed size. We conclude that the phenology of flowering and fruiting in F. alnus comprises several features, each with different and sometimes counteracting effects on fitness components. From a general perspective, this result implies that we should not expect to find finely tuned matches in timing specifically between flowering and pollinators, and fruiting and seed dispersing birds.},

abstract = {Advancing phenology in response to global warming has been reported across biomes1,2, raising concerns about the temporal uncoupling of trophic interactions3,4. Concurrently, widely reported flower visitor declines have been linked to resource limitations5. Phenological responses in the Arctic have been shown to outpace responses from lower latitudes and recent studies suggest that differences between such responses for plants and their flower visitors could be particularly pronounced in the Arctic1,6. The evidence for phenological uncoupling is scant because relevant data sets are lacking7 or not available at a relevant spatial scale8. Here, we present evidence of a climate-associated shortening of the flowering season and a concomitant decline in flower visitor abundance based on a long-term, spatially replicated (1996–2009) data set from high-Arctic Greenland. A unique feature of the data set is the spatial and temporal overlap of independent observations of plant and insect phenology. The shortening of the flowering season arose through spatial variation in phenological responses to warming. The shorter flowering seasons may have played a role in the observed decline in flower visitor abundance. Our results demonstrate that the dramatic climatic changes currently taking place in the Arctic are strongly affecting individual species and ecological communities, with implications for trophic interactions.

abstract = {Analyses of datasets throughout the temperate midlatitude regions show a widespread tendency for species to advance their springtime phenology, consistent with warming trends over the past 20-50 y. Within these general trends toward earlier spring, however, are species that either have insignificant trends or have delayed their timing. Various explanations have been offered to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to warming, including the influence of other abiotic cues (e.g., photoperiod) or reductions in fall/winter chilling (vernalization). Few studies, however, have explicitly attributed the historical trends of nonresponding species to any specific factor. Here, we analyzed long-term data on phenology and seasonal temperatures from 490 species on two continents and demonstrate that (i) apparent nonresponders are indeed responding to warming, but their responses to fall/winter and spring warming are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude; (ii) observed trends in first flowering date depend strongly on the magnitude of a given species' response to fall/winter vs. spring warming; and (iii) inclusion of fall/winter temperature cues strongly improves hindcast model predictions of long-term flowering trends compared with models with spring warming only. With a few notable exceptions, climate change research has focused on the overall mean trend toward phenological advance, minimizing discussion of apparently nonresponding species. Our results illuminate an understudied source of complexity in wild species responses and support the need for models incorporating diverse environmental cues to improve predictability of community level responses to anthropogenic climate change.},

abstract = {Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.},

abstract = {Abstract Insects are declining in abundance and diversity, but their population trends remain uncertain as insects are difficult to monitor. Manual methods require substantial time investment in trapping and subsequent species identification. Camera trapping can alleviate some of the manual fieldwork, but the large quantities of image data are challenging to analyse. By embedding the image analyses into the recording process using computer vision techniques, it is possible to focus efforts on the most ecologically relevant image data. Here, we present an intelligent camera system, capable of detecting, tracking, and identifying individual insects in situ. We constructed the system from commercial off-the-shelf components and used deep learning open source software to perform species detection and classification. We present the Insect Classification and Tracking algorithm (ICT) that performs real-time classification and tracking at 0.33 frames per second. The system can upload summary data on the identity and movement track of insects to a server via the internet on a daily basis. We tested our system during the summer 2020 and detected 2994 insect tracks across 98 days. We achieved an average precision of 89\% for correctly classified insect tracks of eight different species. This result was based on 504 manually verified tracks observed in videos during 10 days with varying insect activities. Using the track data, we could estimate the mean residence time for individual flower visiting insects within the field of view of the camera, and we were able to show a substantial variation in residence time among insect taxa. For honeybees, which were most abundant, residence time also varied through the season in relation to the plant species in bloom. Our proposed automated system showed promising results in non-destructive and real-time monitoring of insects and provides novel information about phenology, abundance, foraging behaviour, and movement ecology of flower visiting insects.}

abstract = {Pollinators are undergoing a global decline. Although vital to pollinator conservation and ecological research, species-level identification is expensive, time consuming, and requires specialized taxonomic training. However, deep learning and computer vision are providing ways to open this methodological bottleneck through automated identification from images. Focusing on bumble bees, we compare four convolutional neural network classification models to evaluate prediction speed, accuracy, and the potential of this technology for automated bee identification. We gathered over 89,000 images of bumble bees, representing 36 species in North America, to train the ResNet, Wide ResNet, InceptionV3, and MnasNet models. Among these models, InceptionV3 presented a good balance of accuracy (91.6{\%}) and average speed (3.34 ms). Species-level error rates were generally smaller for species represented by more training images. However, error rates also depended on the level of morphological variability among individuals within a species and similarity to other species. Continued development of this technology for automatic species identification and monitoring has the potential to be transformative for the fields of ecology and conservation. To this end, we present BeeMachine, a web application that allows anyone to use our classification model to identify bumble bees in their own images.},

abstract = {Ecologists often study wildlife populations by deploying camera traps. Large datasets are generated using this approach which can be difficult for research teams to manually evaluate. Researchers increasingly enlist volunteers from the general public as citizen scientists to help classify images. The growing number of camera trap studies, however, makes it ever more challenging to find enough volunteers to process all projects in a timely manner. Advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, allow for accurate automatic image classification. By training models using existing datasets of images classified by citizen scientists and subsequent application of such models on new studies, human effort may be reduced substantially. The goals of this study were to (a) assess the accuracy of deep learning in classifying camera trap data, (b) investigate how to process datasets with only a few classified images that are generally difficult to model, and (c) apply a trained model on a live online citizen science project.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to differentiate among images of different animal species, images of humans or vehicles, and empty images (no animals, vehicles, or humans). We used four different camera trap datasets featuring a wide variety of species, different habitats, and a varying number of images. All datasets were labelled by citizen scientists on Zooniverse.
Accuracies for identifying empty images across projects ranged between 91.2{\%} and 98.0{\%}, whereas accuracies for identifying specific species were between 88.7{\%} and 92.7{\%}. Transferring information from CNNs trained on large datasets (“transfer‐learning”) was increasingly beneficial as the size of the training dataset decreased and raised accuracy by up to 10.3{\%}. Removing low‐confidence predictions increased model accuracies to the level of citizen scientists. By combining a trained model with classifications from citizen scientists, human effort was reduced by 43{\%} while maintaining overall accuracy for a live experiment running on Zooniverse.
Ecology researchers can significantly reduce image classification time and manual effort by combining citizen scientists and CNNs, enabling faster processing of data from large camera trap studies},

abstract = {Motion-activated cameras (“camera traps”) are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or “out-of-distribution” in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98{\%} accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82{\%} accuracy and correctly identified 94{\%} of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.},

abstract = {Summary Reliable estimates of animal density and abundance are essential for effective wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {Camera traps are a widely used tool in wildlife research and conservation, but in situ factors such as theft, poor performance in extreme environments and damage by wildlife may be hindering the effectiveness of the technology. How- ever, we still know little about how widespread these constraints are and which are the priorities to solve in the short- and mid-term. We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66{\%}, 50{\%} and 42{\%} of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trap- ping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera- trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near- future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data. Ultimately, this will increase the capacity of researchers and conservationists to implement coordinated wildlife monitoring at unprece- dented scales.},

abstract = {Abstract Changes from historic weather patterns have affected the phenology of many organisms world-wide. Altered phenology can introduce organisms to novel abiotic conditions during growth and modify species interactions, both of which could drive changes in reproduction. We explored how climate change can alter plant reproduction using an experiment in which we manipulated the individual and combined effects of snowmelt timing and frost exposure, and measured subsequent effects on flowering phenology, peak flower density, frost damage, pollinator visitation and reproduction of four subalpine wildflowers. Additionally, we conducted a pollen-supplementation experiment to test whether the plants in our snowmelt and frost treatments were pollen limited for reproduction. The four plants included species flowering in early spring to mid-summer. The phenology of all four species was significantly advanced, and the bloom duration was longer in the plots from which we removed snow, but with species-specific responses to snow removal and frost exposure in terms of frost damage, flower production, pollinator visitation and reproduction. The two early blooming species showed significant signs of frost damage in both early snowmelt and frost treatments, which negatively impacted reproduction for one of the species. Further, we recorded fewer pollinators during flowering for the earliest-blooming species in the snow removal plots. We also found lower fruit and seed set for the early blooming species in the snow removal treatment, which could be attributed to the plants growing under unfavourable abiotic conditions. However, the later-blooming species escaped frost damage even in the plots where snow was removed, and experienced increased pollinator visitation and reproduction. Synthesis. This study provides insight into how plant communities could become altered due to changes in abiotic conditions, and some of the mechanisms involved. While early blooming species may be at a disadvantage under climate change, species that bloom later in the season may benefit from early snowmelt, suggesting that climate change has the potential to reshape flowering communities.},

abstract = {The timing of life history traits is central to lifetime fitness and nowhere is this more evident or well studied as in the phenology of flowering in governing plant reproductive success. Recent changes in the timing of environmental events attributable to climate change, such as the date of snowmelt at high altitudes, which initiates the growing season, have had important repercussions for some common perennial herbaceous wildflower species. The phenology of flowering at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA) is strongly influenced by date of snowmelt, which makes this site ideal for examining phenological responses to climate change. Flower buds of Delphinium barbeyi, Erigeron speciosus, and Helianthella quinquenervis are sensitive to frost, and the earlier beginning of the growing season in recent years has exposed them to more frequent mid-June frost kills. From 1992 to 1998, on average 36.1\% of Helianthella buds were frosted, but for 1999–2006 the mean is 73.9\%; in only one year since 1998 have plants escaped all frost damage. For all three of these perennial species, there is a significant relationship between the date of snowmelt and the abundance of flowering that summer. Greater snowpack results in later snowmelt, later beginning of the growing season, and less frost mortality of buds. Microhabitat differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt patterns, and cold air drainage during frost events can be significant; an elevation difference of only 12 m between two plots resulted in a temperature difference of almost 2°C in 2006 and a difference of 37\% in frost damage to buds. The loss of flowers and therefore seeds can reduce recruitment in these plant populations, and affect pollinators, herbivores, and seed predators that previously relied on them. Other plant species in this environment are similarly susceptible to frost damage so the negative effects for recruitment and for consumers dependent on flowers and seeds could be widespread. These findings point out the paradox of increased frost damage in the face of global warming, provide important insights into the adaptive significance of phenology, and have general implications for flowering plants throughout the region and anywhere climate change is having similar impacts.},

We review the evidence that climate change affects populations by shifting species’ phenologies, emphasizing the importance of demographic life-history theory. We find many examples of phenological shifts having both positive and negative consequences for vital rates. Yet, few studies link phenological shifts to changes in vital rates known to drive population dynamics, especially in plants. When this link is made, results are largely consistent with life-history theory: Phenological shifts have population-level consequences when they affect survival in longer-lived organisms and reproduction in shorter-lived organisms. However, there are just as many cases in which demographic mechanisms buffer population growth from phenologically induced changes in vital rates. We provide recommendations for future research aiming to understand the complex relationships among climate, phenology, and demography, which will help to elucidate the extent to which phenological shifts actually alter population persistence. }

abstract = {The earlier flowering times exhibited by many plant species are a conspicuous sign of climate change. Altered phenologies have caused concern that species could suffer population declines if they flower at times when effective pollinators are unavailable. For two perennial wildflowers, Tradescantia ohiensis and Asclepias incarnata, we used an experimental approach to explore how changing phenology affects the taxonomic composition of the pollinator assemblage and the effectiveness of individual pollinator taxa. After finding in the previous year that fruit set varied with flowering time, we manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses, placed plants in the field over the span of five weeks, and measured pollinator effectiveness as the number of seeds produced after a single visit to a flower. The average effectiveness of pollinators and the expected rates of pollination success were lower for plants of both species flowering earlier than for plants flowering at historical times, suggesting there could be reproductive costs to earlier flowering. Whereas for A. incarnata, differences in average seed set among weeks were due primarily to changes in the composition of the pollinator assemblage, the differences for T. ohiensis were driven by the combined effects of compositional changes and increases over time in the effectiveness of some pollinator taxa. Both species face the possibility of temporal mismatch between the availability of the most effective pollinators and the onset of flowering, and changes in the effectiveness of individual pollinator taxa through time may add an unexpected element to the reproductive consequences of such mismatches.},

abstract = {Summary The relative importance of specialized and generalized plant-pollinator relationships is contentious, yet analyses usually avoid direct measures of pollinator quality (effectiveness), citing difficulties in collecting such data in the field and so relying on visitation data alone. We demonstrate that single-visit deposition (SVD) of pollen on virgin stigmas is a practical measure of pollinator effectiveness, using 13 temperate and tropical plant species. For each flower the most effective pollinator measured from SVD was as predicted from its pollination syndrome based on traditional advertisement and reward traits. Overall, c. 40\% of visitors were not effective pollinators (range 0–78\% for different flowers); thus, flower–pollinator relationships are substantially more specialized than visitation alone can reveal. Analyses at species level are crucial, as significant variation in SVD occurred within both higher-level taxonomic groups (genus, family) and within functional groups. Other measures sometimes used to distinguish visitors from pollinators (visit duration, frequency, or feeding behaviour in flowers) did not prove to be suitable proxies. Distinguishing between ‘pollinators’ and ‘visitors’ is therefore crucial, and true ‘pollination networks’ should include SVD to reveal pollinator effectiveness (PE). Generating such networks, now underway, could avoid potential misinterpretations of the conservation values of flower visitors, and of possible extinction threats as modelled in existing networks.},

abstract = {Abstract Many insect species provide essential pollination services. However, the amount of pollen deposited onto a stigma when visiting a flower (‘single visit pollen deposition’, SVD) can vary greatly among taxa depending on morphological traits of pollinators. Further, SVD is commonly measured using one of two methods (‘static’: waiting for an insect to visit a flower present on plant, and ‘active’: removing the flower and presenting it to a flower visitor) that may also differ in their effectiveness. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how SVD compares among pollinators, we conducted a hierarchical meta-analysis using data from 28 studies identified by a systematic review. These contained SVD data for 94 bee and 33 fly taxa (hereafter ‘wild pollinators’), across 30 plant species from which we included 127 observations. In the analysis of each study, we used the western honey bee Apis mellifera as a comparator species. Wild pollinators deposited more pollen onto stigmas per single visit than honeybees, and those with larger body deposited significantly more pollen than smaller ones. Of the two methodological approaches to assess SVD, ‘static’ versus ‘active’, we found no significant difference regarding the amount of deposited pollen. Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis highlights the breadth of wild pollinators that contribute to pollination effectiveness via their delivery of pollen to many crop and non-crop plant species. However, just 25\% of the observations assessed the amount of pollen deposited by fly species. Our findings point to the need to further quantify the pollination effectiveness of non-bee pollinators as studies have largely focused on managed and wild bee species.},

abstract = {Abstract Global climate change has sparked a vast research effort into the demographic and evolutionary consequences of mismatches between consumer and resource phenology. Many studies have used the difference in peak dates to quantify phenological synchrony (match in dates, MD), but this approach has been suggested to be inconclusive, since it does not incorporate the temporal overlap between the phenological distributions (match in overlap, MO). We used 24 years of detailed data on the phenology of a predator–prey system, the great tit (Parus major) and the main food for its nestlings, caterpillars, to estimate MD and MO at the population and brood levels. We compared the performance of both metrics on two key demographic parameters: offspring recruitment probability and selection on the timing of reproduction. Although MD and MO correlated quadratically as expected, MD was a better predictor for both offspring recruitment and selection on timing than MO. We argue—and verify through simulations—that this is because quantifying MO has to be based on nontrivial, difficult-to-verify assumptions that likely render MO too inaccurate as a proxy for food availability in practice. Our results have important implications for the allocation of research efforts in long-term population studies in highly seasonal environments.},
